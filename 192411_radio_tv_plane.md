N a recent trip to Washington the writer visited the labora­ tories of C.  Francis  Jenki ns, the well-known experi menter of
international reputation. It was Mr. Jenkins who perfected the shutter that made our present-day motion pictures possi ble.  He was paid  over $1,000,-
000  for  this   invention.
Of late he has been experimenting with television and has already ob­ tained  astonishing  results.  At   the time of the writer's visit Mr. Jenki ns demonstrated his television machine before a number of Government rep­ resentatives, including the  Chief  of the Signal Corps. At that time the writer actually saw his own waving hand, projected by radio over a dis­ tance of some thi rty  feet, the shadow of the waving hand  being  transmit­ ted  to  a  screen  at  that  distance. Every motion made by  the writer's hand was  faithfully  reprod uced  on the distant screen. Opaque  sub­ stances. such as a cross, knife, pen­ cil. etc.. were also successf ully trans­ mitted and projected by the Jenkins Television machine.
It is the writer's  opinion  that, within two or three years, it will be possible for a man i n New York to listen  over  his  radio  to  a  ball  game
500  miles  away  and  see  the  players
on a screen before him at the same time. Whether it will be the Jenki ns machi ne or some other machine that will achie,·e this result is of little consequence. The main thing is that experimenters all over the world are working frantically on television and sooner or later the problem will be solved.
An entirely new age will then be opened up and it is  not  necessary  for the  writer  to  expatiate  at  length  on this phase ; as it  has  been  exploited by him i n his past writ ings and by others   for  some  time.
In  this  article.   we   shall concern ou rsch·es with the radio-controlled television plane, which will come into being immediately the min ute the television problem is put on a  practi­ cal basis. It should not be construed that the radio  television  plane  is merely a  monstrous war  machine, but it also has its uses during  peace time, as will be explained. At the present time   it  costs   great  effort,  time  andi

aviators' lives in  order  to  train our perf ect flyers.
A radio-controlled airplane has al­ ready  been  demonstrated  by   the French  and  American  Governments, and it flew for a  lengthy  period  with­ out anyone on board . The entire  con­ trol was from the ground while the machine was alof t. The  plane  arose, cut  figure  eights,  volplaned,  ascended,

that the radio-controlled airplane has passed the  experimental  stages  and has become practical and feasible for military  use.
But the great trouble with radio-con­ trolled airplanes is that the operator must see the plane. If his machi ne were to make a landing at a great distance  he  might  land  the airplane on top of  a  building  or in  a  river, or it  might  collide  with  a mountain.
A Pilot-less Plane Which "Sees" Imagine  now  a  radio-controlled pi­
lot-less airplane which is also equipped with electrical eyes, which eyes trans­ mit  the  impulses-or  rather   what these eyes "see," by radio-to the dis­ tant-control operator  on  the  ground. Ou r illustration on the opposite page, which shows a war machine, depicts this phase. Here we have a radio­ controlled airplane equipped with a number of lenses which gather in t he light from six different directions, namel)". north, south, east, west.  up and down. The impulses  are  sent to the operator on  the  ground,  who has in front of him six television screens labeled "North," "South." "East." "\Vest," "Up" and  "Down."  Each screen corresponds to one of  the   elec­ t ric eyes attached firmly  to  the body of the airplane, as shown in the illus­ tration.
Let us now see what happens. The airplane is started from  the  ground and is sent over the enemy territor)·. Duri ng every second of its fight the control operator, although 50, 100 or possibly 500 miles away, will see ex­ actly what goes on around the plane. just the same as if he himself were seated in the cockpit ; with the further advantage that, sitting  before  a screen. he can scan six directions  all at once, which no h uman aviator can do. If, for instance, an enemy  air­ plane suddenly comes out of a cloud and starts droppi ng bombs on our machine below, the cor.trol operator sees this enemy machine quicker 500 miles awar, than if an aviator  sat in the cockpit one-quarter of a m ile away from or below the enemy bomb­ er. The control operator  will  send a rad io signal that will immed iately d is­ charge a smoke screen from his radio telel'ision plane. hiding his craf t in smoke.   He  can  also  make  it   turn

rangement can be  attached  to  the plane in such  a  manner  that,  when the object to be bombed  comes over the  cross-wires  in  the  range-finder, the bomb or bom bs are dropped at the exact moment.  Suppose  that  the enemy becomes too strong and that a great number of mach ines attack the rad io-controlled  plane  and  that there is no escape from the enemy. In that case the control operator  will  simply set the radio television plane on fire, bringing it down in flames! Th us it would be useless to the enemy and no lives will  have  been  risked  or taken­ it being cheaper to destroy a mach ine than the valuable life of a  highly trained  pilot.
In the future such radio-controlled television planes may be used not only
