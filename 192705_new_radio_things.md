> *. . . In which the Editor comments on the present tendency in radio circles to follow the well-known Calf Path---and suggests a few profitable lines for future experiment---what the Super-Regenerator promises---the need for truly portable sets---and the desirability of commercial apparatus to make them practicable---new tubes, new condensers, new coils---and finally adds a practicable "wrinkle" of his own invention---the "Cane Loop," which makes a most compact and portable antenna for any set . . .*

**T**HE progress of radio has been rather slow during the past two years.  From the experimenter's standpoint there have been few really new things to occupy him.  There have been no revolutionary circuits, nor, as a matter of fact, do we expect them.  Radio progress during the past two years may be said to have been refinement and improvement of what we already had.  But there are many things still to be worked out, and a great deal of progress, as a matter of fact, the greatest progress, is as yet to come.  The trouble with most of us is that we follow the well-beaten path, and as a rule we follow the leader.  Very few experimenters and designers have the courage to step out from well-worn radio paths, because, as a rule, they are afraid that the results of their labors will be called freaks or worse.
