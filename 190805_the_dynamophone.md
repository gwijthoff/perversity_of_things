While conducting some experiments in wireless telephony I made the discovery of quite an interesting combination which, to my knowledge of the art, has not been tried up to this date.

To produce mechanical effects directly, man is obliged to exert his muscular forces, by bringing his muscles in contact with the object to be moved, or through an indirect way, namely, by interposing a tool between the muscle and the object.  This tool might be a lever or it might be a telegraph key, which latter, if desired, will move or disturb the far-off object through another medium, electricity.

To apply power to an object the hand is used more than any other part of the human body; the food probably ranges next.  The whole body, mostly applied as a lever, follows.  The head is practically never used at all.  The lungs are used very little comparatively, for instance in glass blowing, etc.

The voice has never been used, no case on record that a motor or a dynamo was started solely by talking, to or through a medium.  I am, of course, well aware that by talking in a transmitter the telephone diaphragm at the other end will vibrate, but that can hardly be called power, it being proved that in most cases the vibrations of a receiver diaphragm measure less that one-five-thousandths of an inch.  To provide a contact on the diaphragm in order that the vibrations should close a certain circuit, which in turn could be relayed, to transmit or start power, has always proved a failure on account of the vibrations of the diaphragm, created by the human voice, being exceedingly weak.

My arrangement, as described below, to transmit or start power, etc., simply by talking into a transmitter, will therefore be found novel, especially if it is considered that the transmitter is not connected with the receiving station whatsoever.  The transmission is made by means of wireless electric radiations.

No new apparatus being needed in my arrangement, any amateur can easily perform the experiment.

Referring to plan, M represents the common transmitter as used on most telephones.  R is a fairly sensitive pony relay of seventy-five ohms.  C is a condenser to absorb excessive sparking; I, induction coil; S, oscillator balls.

The tension of the adjusting spring H on the relay should be just sufficient to keep the armature away from contact G.  With a little experimenting the right tension will be ascertained.

By talking medium loud in the transmitter, the resistance in same will be varied accordingly and the armature will close the circuit at G, through battery B and coil I, which may be a common one-inch spark-coil not deprived of its vibrator.

Every time the circuit is closed at G a series of sparks will jump across the balls at S, creating oscillations.  These oscillations, traveling through the ether, arrive at the receiving station, where they impinge on the antennae A and operate the coherer O through relay R'.  The decoherer D is also shown.  Relay, coherer and decoherer are all operated by a single dry cell L.  This is the same circuit as in my "Telimco" wireless system.  Relay R' has in addition two stationary contacts T and T', which, when the armature Z closes, complete another circuit, as, for instance, through a small motor P, an incandescent light, etc.

As long as words are spoken in the transmitter M, oscillations will be set up in S and the receiving station will work continuously until the voice at M stops.  Motor P will, of course, be kept in motion only as long as the voice talks into M.
