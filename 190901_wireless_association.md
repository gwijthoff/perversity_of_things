It affords the Editor genuine pleasure to offer to the thousands of wireless enthusiasts an appropriate New Year's present in form of the Wireless Association of America.  Every reader perusing the announcement of the association, found elsewhere in this issue, will agree that such an organization has been needed for a long time.

Wireless Telegraphy may now be said to have left the experimental stage.  It has become an everyday necessity, and already rivals the wire and cable telegraph.  Between sea and land wireless is of the utmost importance and to-day forms as necessary an adjunct to every up-to-date vessel, as its coal and lifeboats.

Only a few days ago Wireless demonstrated anew its utility.  Several Italian warships were at sea, when the disaster occurred in southern Italy, necessitating prompt assistance by outside help.  The warships were at once recalled by means of wireless, and through it have saved the lives of hundreds of sufferers and brought the much needed relief.[^qke]

Not alone on sea, or between land and sea, but on the mainland also, Wireless is of high importance.  Only a few weeks ago two young Wireless experimenters saved several hundred lives in southern France in a dramatic manner.  One of the young men, living on a hill near a dam, discovered that it was giving way, which meant the destruction of a small village in the valley below and the drowning of hundreds.  He promptly "called up" his friend living in the village below who gave the alarm.  Over two hundred people reached the mountain in safety, just in time to avoid the flood.  Without Wireless they would have been surely drowned, as telephone and telegraph are unknown in that locality and the person in charge of the dam was sick on account of a recent accident.

The greatest aim of the Wireless Association of America is to bring young experimenters together---not in clubs, but in practical work.  The Editor would like to see every reader of "Modern Electrics"; in possession of a wireless station; there is really nothing more instructive and entertaining than a wireless between two isolated, or for that matter, distant points in a city.  The necessary instruments, thanks to competition are now so cheap that they are in reach of everybody, and we have as yet to hear of the person regretting an investment in wireless instruments.

The Association's button will also be of great help to bring young experimenters, unknown to each other, together.  As only a few thousand buttons were ordered, prospective members should send at once for same, as it will take several weeks to obtain a new supply.

# Wireless Association of America

## Under Auspices of "Modern Electrics"

### Board of Directors

- Dr. Lee de Forest, President
- John S. Stone, Vice-President
- Wm. Maver, Jr., Secretary
- Hugo Gernsback, Chairman & Business Manager

The Wireless Association of America has been founded with the sole object of furthering the interests of wireless telegraphy and aerophony in America.

We are now on the threshold of the wireless era, and just beginning to rub our intellectual eyes, as it were.  Sometimes we look over the wall of our barred knowledge in amazement, wondering what lays beyond the wall, as yet covered with a dense haze.

However, young America, up to the occasion, is wide awake as usual.

Foreign wireless experts, invariable exclaim in wonder when viewing the photographs appearing each month in the "Wireless Contest" of this magazine.  They cannot grasp the idea that boys 14 years old actually operate wireless stations successfully every day in the year under all conditions, but they are all of the undivided opinion that Young America leads the rest of the world wirelessly.

Even Dr. Lee de Forest, America's foremost wireless authority, confessed himself surprised that so many young men in this country should be in the possession of such well constructed and well managed wireless stations, which is only another proof that the clear headed young men of this country are unusually advanced in the youngest branch of electrical science.

So far America has lead [sic] in the race.  The next thing is to stay in the front, and let the others follow.  In fact he would be a bold prophet who would dare hint at the wonders to come during the next decade.

The boy experimenting in an attic today may be an authority to-morrow.  However, not even the cleverest inventors or experimenters always have opportunity of making themselves known to the world, and it is right here that we are confronted with a mystery so far unsolved.  Out of 100 per cent of young wireless experimenters, 90 per cent. are extremely bashful.  Why this should be so is a mystery.

As stated before the new Wireless Association's sole aim is to further the interests of experimental wireless telegraphy and aerophony in this country.  Headed by America's foremost wireless men, it is not a money-making institution.  There are no membership fees, and no contributions required to become a member.

There are two conditions only.  Each member of the Association *must be an American citizen* and MUST OWN A WIRELESS STATION, either for sending or for receiving or both.

The Association furnishes a membership button as per our illustration.  This button is sold at actual cost and will be mailed to each member on receipt or 15 cents (no stamps nor checks).

This button is made of bronze, triple silver-plated.  The flashes from the wireless pole are laid in in hard red enamel, which makes the button quite distinctive.  The button furthermore has the usual screw back making it easy to fasten to buttonhole.  The lettering itself is laid in in black hard enamel.  Size exactly as cut.

On account of the heavy plating it will last for years and is guaranteed not to wear "brassy."

Its diameter is 3/4 inch.  This is a trifle larger than usual, the purpose being to show the button off so that it
