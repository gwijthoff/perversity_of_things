**W**E have spoken several times of inventions and the present editorial is one on cultivating inventions.

Generally speaking, there are two kinds of inventing.  One is achieved by the man who can't help inventing new things; he is a born inventor, just like a musician to whom music comes naturally and who never needed a teacher.  The second kind of inventing is the mechanical kind.  By this is meant the kind of inventing that is done by persons to whom inventing does not come natural, but those who are suddenly confronted with a certain device that to their minds seems imperfect, whereupon they will bend their energies towards improving the existing device.

The born inventor differs from the mechanical one in that to him ideas come suddenly, without the slightest suggestion.  The writer, for instance, who has invented a number of devices will suddenly have a certain idea, of which he perhaps never thought before.  Within less than ten seconds after the first impression of the idea, he will see the entire device, down to the smallest detail clearly before his mental eye and from that mental picture a complicated sketch of the device can be drawn immediately without reflection or real thinking; just like copying an existing drawing.

Considered all in all, the two kinds of inventors, as far as their inventions go are nearly equally matched.  The born inventor will usually invent a great many things, three fourths of which are useless: he becomes guilty of over-production.  The mechanical inventor invents very few things as a rule and most of them are usually useful.  Thus nature tries to maintain the universal equilibrium.[^1]

A few words of advice to the two kinds of inventors does not seem out of place.

The fundamental test of any invention should always be whether it is better or cheaper than existing devices and whether it will be profitable to market the invention.

Most inventors, on account of being far too enthusiastic and optimistic, fool themselves by not considering in cold blood all the defects of their devices.  There was never an invention that had not its bad points and weak spots.  These should be considered most critically by the inventor, because if he does not do it, the world will soon enough do it with surprising thoroughness, usually to the dismay of the misguided inventor.

Never market an invention before it is completely worked out and "fool-proof."  If it has weak spots, try and improve on same, if you don't do it, your competitors will do it for you at your expense.  It is fallacious to think that as long as the device works after a fashion it should be put on the market and the improving done afterward.  Nothing is more preposterous.  Witness the sad fiasco of the Wireless Telephone, exploited by several American companies, who are now defunct.[^2]  One of them erected costly steel towers from 100-200 feet high in dozens of cities in this country, and the great defects of the "arc" wireless telephone must have been well known to the technical staff as well as to the promoters.  Nevertheless, they plunged along, trusting to god luck that the improvements were only child's play and would find themselves.  However, the improvements did not materialize in time to avert the final crash and the tall steel towers to-day are sad monuments of inventors' folly and shout their warning to inventors who would market inventions before they are ripe.[^3]

[^1]:  (1. "invention" 2. innovation/creativity 3. nonwestern tinkering) Gernsback overlooks here precisely what allows the idea of an invention to form in the first place.  Rather than emphasizing the creativity of the lone genius inventor, historians of technology speek of the ways technologies are *socially* constructed.  Any invention must take place within the context of what Wiebe Bijker calls a technological frame:

    > the concepts and techniques employed by a community in its problem solving.  Problem solving should be read as a broad concept, encompassing within it the recognition of what counts as a problem as well as the strategies available for solving the problems and the requirements a solution has to meet. (“The Social Construction of Bakelite” in The Social Construction of Technological Systems, p. 164).
    
    Bijker's example is Bakelite plastic, but other examples abound.  André Bazin asks, for instance, why the cinema wasn't invented until a century after all of its necessary technical components existed, if it was simply a matter of assembling them?  Following Bijker, the answer would be that the technological frame of cinema as we know it today---its aesthetic, its grammar, its modes of production and reception---simply didn't exist yet, even though, conceivably, it was a *material* possibility.  

    Perhaps due to the inherent complexity of technology today, and to a lesser extent, the theoretical frameworks that have reoriented from the individual to how the social environment structures the design of a technology, we speak today not of invention but of innovation.  Academic discourse about "cultivating", a la Gernsback, innovation is a new field. 
    
    More on "creativity" and ingenuity.  Current fad for writings on creativity (see Zotero category).  Far apart from the model of divine inspiration (struck in a single moment "without real thought," a wholly formed idea, creativity is now seen as an "academic discipline" in its own right, curated and   Also, stuff on tinkering vs. inventing now seen in the critical literature as reflecting hemispheric divide.  The global south / non-western cultures.  See "Rethinking Repair."

[^3]:  As we will see, this is a rare moment in which Gernsback is utterly wrong in one of his predictions, especially in such a short timeframe.  Radio towers would be de riguer in a decade's time, broadcasting boxing matches, news, and weather.  (The Big Switch?)
