> *THE articles in RADIO NEWS are in my opinion "inspired" by your advertisers and of little value to your subscribers. Most radio magazines are similarly unreliable. Why don't you occasionally publish something worth while? Your readers are not all morons. When and if you publish a radio magazine for the benefit of your subscribers rather than your advertisers, I will again subscribe. Who wants a catalog?*

**W**HEN the first number of RADIO NEWS was launched in July, 1919, I said as follows: "And here is the platform upon which RADIO NEWS stands.  I pledge myself to a strict adherence to every plank:

"First: Only Radio---100% of it---nothing else.

"Second: An organ for and by the amateur. The amateur's likes and wants will always come first in this magazine.

"Third: Absolute Independence. RADIO NEWS has only one Boss---its readers.  This magazine is not, nor will it ever be, affiliated with any stifling, commercial radio interests whatsoever.

"Fourth: Truth---first, last and always.  When you see it in RADIO NEWS you may be sure that it is so.  Not being affiliated with commercial radio interests, this magazine will have no reason to suppress important articles, discoveries, etc.

"Fifth: RADIO NEWS is and will be the sworn enemy of all adverse and unfair radio leglislation.

"Sixth: Instructive first and last. Up-to-date scientific articles for yoru instruction will always have first place in RADIO NEWS.  We shall publish purely scientific articles every month, articles that on account of their length are often crowded out of other publications.

"Seventh: First in print with the news.  You will find all important radio news in this magazine from one to three months ahead of all other publications---always."

That was before the days of broadcasting and when radio fans were still "bugs" and transmitting amateurs; but, as a whole, the situation has not changed, nor has the platform of RADIO NEWS changed at all.

On the other hand, in an art that grows as rapidly as radio, changes occur overnight and it is necessary for any organization, whether a publisher or a factory, to conform itself to those changes.  For instance, in 1919 there were some 10,000 amateurs, and not one of the so-called "broadcast fans," because there was yet no broadcasting.

When broadcasting came along, it meant an important change, not only to the amateurs and fans, but to the radio industry as a whole.  Changes came about with lightning rapidity, yet RADIO NEWS adapted itself to them to give the maximum service, not only to its readers, but to the whole industry as well.

RADIO NEWS has always been the largest of all the radio publications in point of circulation, and otherwise; and as such, it has a tremendous obligation to, not only the radio art itself, but all interests connected with it---readers, fans, amateurs or the industry.  As the strongest and most representative of all the radio publications, RADIO NEWS has always valiantly striven to be of service to all concerned.

From 1919 to 1926, it was the policy of RADIO NEWS never to mention the name of any product within its text pages.  RADIO NEWS has always maintained that the proper place to advertise a product is in the advertising pages rather than in the text pages.  However, toward the end of 1926, it was seen that the radio parts industry was heading rapidly downward; and it became necessary, as it had been necessary before during similar changes, to recognize the altered conditions.  During the radio boom, there were some 30,000 dealers in this country handling radio parts; at the end of 1926, this number had shrunk to no more than 2,500.

RADIO NEWS then was confronted with a most perplexing and difficult problem.  Its readers always had been amateurs, fans, and constructors who built their own, as well as custom builders.  For that reason, many new and novel circuits were published in RADIO NEWS, such as the Tropadyne, Ultradyne, Strobodyne, Interflex, and many others of national and international importance.  But RADIO NEWS also recognized the obligation to see to it that the man who wanted to build his own *could* do so.  This, of course, is elementary: if you write a book on bridge, and it becomes impossible for the readers of that book to buy playing cards, the book is useless.  If you publish a golf magazine and it is impossible for the readers to buy golf clubs and golf balls anywhere in the country, you will not stay in business long; neither will a publication advance the golf industry if it does not help create markets for the golf manufacturers.  All this is self-evident; RADIO NEWS is in a postion not at all different.
