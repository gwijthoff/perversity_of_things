while people like Tesla had already established the fact that invention was part of an entire discursive network of speculations, projections, etc., Gernsback was able to popularize these forms of using technology.  His work is all about amateurs thinking in the same way, and everyday people feeling this amazement as they use technology, not as dumb spectators with their minds blown by the magician Tesla, but as active participants.  Which actually makes him an interesting figure in Lori Emerson's argument that technology today (Apple especially) has become too magical.  Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.
