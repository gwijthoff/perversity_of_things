while people like Tesla had already established the fact that invention was part of an entire discursive network of speculations, projections, etc., Gernsback was able to popularize these forms of using technology.  His work is all about amateurs thinking in the same way, and everyday people feeling this amazement as they use technology, not as dumb spectators with their minds blown by the magician Tesla, but as active participants.  Which actually makes him an interesting figure in Lori Emerson's argument that technology today (Apple especially) has become too magical.  Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.

Paul and illustrations
=======================

Gernsback says that producing realistic illustrations of the future is the most difficult, and most rewarding part of the magazine, and that the idea is to fire the imagination of a reader/experimenter:  "It is no easy matter to think out new things of the future and illustrating them adequately by means of expensive washdrawings or three-color cover illustrations.  Indeed, there is nothing more difficult connected with the publication." ("Imagination Versus Facts")
