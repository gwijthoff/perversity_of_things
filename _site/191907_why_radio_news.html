<p><strong>R</strong>ADIO AMATEUR NEWS with this issue makes its debut to the radio fraternity. At this occasion it may not be amiss to state the pertinent reasons for its existence and why as a matter of fact it just <em>had</em> to come.</p>

<p>This magazine is the logical outcome of many attempts to publish a purely Radio periodical, independent thruout and devoted to American Radio Amateurism.</p>

<p>In 1908 I started the first magazine in America in which were publisht many radio articles—MODERN ELECTRICS. Radio Amateurism being in its infancy then, could not support a purely radio magazine,—so MODERN ELECTRICS devoted only about one-quarter of its contents to radio. In 1913 I came out with the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER. This magazine has been more prominent than any other on account of its very important radio section. Even during the war—with radio amateurism dead and nearly every radio magazine discontinued—the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER, at a great financial loss, continued publishing radio articles uninterruptedly, month after month, to keep alive the radio spark in the hearts of our amateurs.</p>

<p>But now that the war is won,—now that the amateurs have won <em>their</em> war by defeating a proposed new law which would have destroyed American Radio Amateurism—we will witness the most wonderful expansion of the radio arts ever dreamt of. The amateur is here to stay and so is radio in general. I predict an astounding growth of the art during the next ten years. Every other house will have its radiophone, to converse with friends and relatives, for business and for pleasure. Marvelous inventions will be made in Radio during the next decade—unbelieveable now .</p>

<p>Because I am a staunch believer in the glorious future of Radio in America, I have launched RADIO AMATEUR NEWS. Its first issue will mark the time when amateur radio in America has come into its own again, when it has been re-born greater than ever—a Phenix rising more beautiful than before from his ashes.</p>

<p>I felt that the time was ripe for a purely radio magazine—a 100% radio magazine,—by and for the amateur. I felt that a magazine for the entire radio fraternity, be he scientist, advanced, or junior amateur, was badly needed, and that is why you are now reading this the first issue Of the newcomer.</p>

<p>And here is the platform upon which RADIO AMATEUR NEWS stands. I pledge myself to a strict adherence to every plank:</p>

<p>lst. Only Radio—100% of it—<em>nothing else.</em></p>

<p>2nd. An Organ for and by the amateur. The amateur’s likes and wants will always come first in this magazine.</p>

<p>3rd. Absolute Independence. RADIO AMATEUR NEWS has only one Boss—its readers. This magazine is not, nor will it ever be affiliated with any stifling, commercial radio interests whatsoever.</p>

<p>4th. Truth—first, last and always. When you see it in RADIO AMATEUR NEWS you may be sure that it is so. Not being affiliated with commercial radio interests, this magazine will have no reason to suppress important articles discoveries etc.</p>

<p>5th. RADIO AMATEUR NEWS is and will be the sworn enemy of all adverse and unfair radio legislation. Our Washington representative will inform us immediately of any new radio legislative measures. No unfair bill will become a law before all amateurs have had their say.</p>

<p>6th. The uplift of American Radio Amateurism out of the “kid” class, into the serious status to which the art is entitled. Amateur Radio is not a plaything or a sport—it is a useful mind ennobling art—it vanquishes distances, it saves lives and it will be as necessary as the telephone ten years hence.</p>

<p>7th. Instructive first and last. Up-to-date scientific articles for your instruction will always have first place in RADIO AMATEUR NEWS. We shall publish purely scientific articles every month, articles that on account of their length are often crowded out of other publications.</p>

<p>8th. First in print with the News. You will find all important Radio News in this magazine from one to three months ahead of all other publications—always.</p>

<p>Now, my friends, it’s up to you how great and how big RADIO AMATEUR NEWS shall be. Its future is in your hands. We’re off……</p>

<p>Three cheers for American Radio Amateurism—</p>

<p><em>Long live the Radio Amateur.</em></p>
