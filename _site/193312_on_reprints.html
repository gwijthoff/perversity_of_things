<hr />

<p>Frequently, we have received letters from readers of the QUARTERLY urging us to publish in the QUARTERLY reprints of famous science fiction.</p>

<p>Often, the readers send us a list of titles regarding full length novels which they have heard mentioned, with a request that we reprint such and such a book.</p>

<p>The reprint idea has come up often, and we have expressed ourselves frequently in our letters to readers, but, of late, so many letters have been received that I take this means of explaining the position of WONDER STORIES QUARTERLY:</p>

<p>When I first started to publish science fiction in regular magazine form back in 1926, I republished a number of science fiction classics.  The selection finally narrowed itself down to only a very few stories, and thereafter practically no reprints of full book length novel were attempted.  The reason is very simple.  I have, as yet, to see one old time science fiction novel which, in the light of today’s advance in science fiction, is readable.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the majority of Jules Verne’s books.  Quite a number of them read so tamely today that the average reader would yawn.  The incredible wonders in Jules Verne’s day are commonplaces today.  The same is the case with a number of other older science fiction books.  Time has caught up with them, and progress has been such that the authors’ predictions have mostly been fulfilled, leaving the present-day reader with a very ordinary story on his hands.</p>

<p>There are, of course, a few notable exceptions.  The trouble with these exceptions, however, is that the owners of the copyrights for one reason or another refuse to allow reprinting of the story in a magazine.  They perhaps figure that this would hurt the book sale.  This obscure reasoning, to our minds, is, of course, foolish, but makes no impression on certain publishers even if they have not sold a single one of their books in ten years.</p>

<p>We have, time and again, ransacked the market for old science fiction books, but so far, we have not been able to find a book which we would enthusiastically reprint in the QUARTERLY.</p>

<p>We think we are pretty well posted on all of the former books, but in the very nature of things, we cannot know all of them.  There may be some titles that have escaped us, although it is doubtful.</p>

<p>If you, our reader, come across a genuine volume of science fiction, that can be reprinted today without trying the reader’s patience, we shall, of course, be only too glad to know of such a book.  We will try and secure the rights for republication, if that is possible.</p>

<p>If, therefore, you know of any such titles, we shall be delighted to hear from you, and take this means to thank you in advance for your cooperation.</p>
