<hr />

<p><strong>F</strong>ROM time immemorial, crass ignorance and great scientific discoveries have cheerfully trotted side by side.  Whether it was Columbus discovering a new world, or whether it was Galileo who maintained that the world was turning around the sun and not <em>vice versa</em>—a stupid and narrow humanity was ever ready to step in and command a threatening <em>Halt!</em> to scientific exploits.</p>

<p>It is no different with radio.  No sooner has the new art demonstrated its inconceivable boon to the world that some well-meaning but misguided official steps up and frantically tries to shackle it down, hands, body and feet.</p>

<p>We ask ourselves with horror what would have happened to our telephones if our Government had taken control of them in the early eighties, as was the case in most European countries.  Today there are more telephones in New York City than in France and Belgium combined.  A single New York building—the Hudson Terminal building—has more telephones than all of Greece!</p>

<p>Now Europe needs the telephone no less than America, but it has been proved time and again that it is the Government control which retards development.  As soon as the Government steps in, competition as well as the natural development ceases—the art decays.</p>

<p>If this is true of the telephone and telegraph, how much truer is it of Radio?  And particularly Radio in the United States—the land of enormous distances, where Radio will be more necessary within twenty-five years than the wire telephone is to-day.</p>

<p>We are certain that if the men who now advocate Government Radio control were possest of but a little vision as to the marvelous future and the possibilities of Radio, they would recoil with horror at their preposterous suggestions.</p>

<p>At the present the radio art comprises but two branches:  Radio telegraphy and telephony.  Before the war the latter was only a laboratory experiment.  To-day sets are being sold at a low price that plug into your lamp socket and you can then talk to your friend thirty miles away—be he in the house, his auto, his yacht or in his airship.  Soon every farmhouse will boast its radiophone.  Every limousine will be equipt with it.  How would these developments fare under Government control?</p>

<p>But these two applications are but a small part of the whole art of Radio.  Take for instance <em>Distant Radio Control.</em>  Switches can now be thrown by wireless a hundred miles away.  Alarm horns can be sounded without wires from five to fifty miles distant.</p>

<p>Then we have the <em>Radio Telautomata,</em> as first invented by Nikola Tesla.  This famous inventor has worked out plans whereby it is possible to send as ship across the Atlantic without a human being on board.  The entire control is by radio; and the ship is guided unerringly to its harbor by a man who sits in an office building in New York.  The ship automatically discloses its position hourly to its New York control office by means of the Radio Compass.</p>

<p>But one of the most important branches of the new art is undoubtedly <em>Radio Power Transmission.</em>  Nikola Tesla, the inventor of the system, already demonstrated the feasibility of this in his famous colorado experiments in 1898.  He was able to light lamps hundreds of feet away without the use of wires, using only a ground connection.  To be sure no Hertzian waves were used in these experiments, but the transmission of energy was accomplished wirelessly.</p>

<p>In the face of these developments in the Radio Act, who can doubt that the future will bring forth still more wonderful achievements, not to be imagined to-day by the most fervid imagination.</p>

<p>And now Washington officials once more threaten this art—a distinctly American art—the eighth wonder of the modern world.  But the country at large wants no further harmful radio legislation, we are certain.  On page 190 we found a few voices.  Radio enthusiasts should read particularly Mr. Manderville’s letter to his Senator—and follow suit.  Let our slogan be:  <em>“Hands off Radio.</em>”</p>

<h2 id="radio-restrictions-off">Radio Restrictions Off</h2>

<p>Washington, Sept. 27—Effective Oct. 1, all restrictions on amateur radio stations are removed.  This applies to amateur stations, technical and experimental stations at schools and colleges, and to all other stations except those used for the purpose of transmitting or receiving commercial traffic of any character.  These restrictions on stations handling commercial traffic will remain in effect until the President proclaims that a state of peace exists.</p>

<p>Attention is invited to the fact that all licenses for transmitting stations have expired and that it will be necessary for the amateurs to apply to the Department of Commerce for new licenses.  So far as amateurs are concerned, radio resumes its pre-war status under the Department of Commerce.</p>
