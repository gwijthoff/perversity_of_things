**T**ELEVISION, which has been in the making for the last twenty-five years, and the perfecting of which has been freely predicted in many technical articles by many writers, as well as by myself, is now a reality.  No longer need we look into the future for it.  Although not perfected so that it can be attached to every telephone or to every radio set, television is, today, in a state comparable to that of radio, when its principles were first laid down by Heinrich Hertz, in 1888, and to that of Bell's crude telephone, in 1876.  It will take a few years to develop the television apparatus out of the laboratory stage, and much work as yet remains to be done.  This is always the case when bringing the laboratory product to the final and practical everyday use with any instrument or technical appliance.  It may take two years and even five years before every telephone and every radio set is finally equipped with its television attachment, but you may rest assured that this generation will soon personally witness the appearance of this stage of the art.  There can be no doubt about it.  But, and we may ask this question soberly,---"After television, what next?"

It is now possible to hear and see a person over a wire line, or over the radio.  We have, therefore, made it possible to *transport two senses,* so to speak, to a distance, the two senses being sight and hearing.

In these days of wonder and achievement, we should ask ourselves the question, "What other of our senses is it possible to transport a distance, and, from our present-day knowledge of science, is it possible to transport any of them at all?"

The remaining senses are smell, taste and touch.  Now, then, of course nothing can be said to be impossible, although some things are highly improbable.  Thus, the next of the senses on the list being smell, is it possible to smell at a distance?  I might say that this is not impossible, although highly improbable.  From a technical standpoint, it may be quite possible to build an instrument highly sensitive to odors, which instrument would be able to distinguish between the most subtle variations of various smells or odors.  The next step would then be to amplify these, which presumably could be done by means of vacuum tube amplifiers.  After that, transmission could be effected electrically by many ways not known.

At the receiving side the impulses would be stepped up and some means would have to be provided to unscramble the odors.  We can imagine, for instance, 5,000 small tanks at the receiving end, eahc of which would release, upon a contact being made, an amount of odor depending upon how much was wanted, as indicated by the impressed signal.  Thus it would be possible to *recreate* at the receiving end, odors or smells similar to those sent out from the transmitter.  All perfectly possible, but, and here comes the big question mark, why would any one want to do it?  It would cost a million dollars or more to build such an apparatus, and to what good?  So I would say, "Not impossible, but highly improbably."

The next sense to be transmitted would be touch.  Again I will say, "Not impossible, but somewhat improbably."  It should be a simple thing to construct an electrical apparatus operated at a distance, to transport the sense of touch, in some ways.  For instance, it is possible, today, to build an apparatus that, by means of television, would enable mechanical fingers to open the combination of a safe.  You would watch by television a mechanical hand, of which you would operate a duplicate at the sending end, and you could thus open or close the combination of the safe without much trouble.  This is not impossible, nor is it improbable, but, as with the transportation of the sense of smell, there would not be many uses for such a device.

We have with us today the science of *telemechanics,* which means, operating either by wire or by radio an apparatus at a distance.  Some years ago, before television was invented, I described the radio-controlled television plane, which will make it possible, in a not-far-distant future, to operate an airplane without a human being on board, and which, being provided with television apparatus, will enable a distant operator to see and guide the plane over enemy territory and drop bombs at any desired instant, although no one be on board the airplane.[^bmb]  We may call this "touch at a distance" and, in fact, it is just that.  This is not only quite possible, but will be done in the next few years.

But when it comes, for instance, to actually *feeling* the texture of a piece of cloth, at a distance of a thousand miles, this would seem to be highly improbably, at least for practical purposes.

The remaining sense, namely, taste, may be classed with the transportation of the sense of smell.[^sns]  It is not impossible, but highly improbably.  A machine can be invented whereby, just like the one explained under odors, certain impressions are made upon certain media, when certain foods or liquids are placed upon it.  The tongue, by dissolving certain of the ingredients of the foods or liquids, gives the sensation of taste.  The counterpart of an electrical tongue would present no insurmountable difficulties to a clever physicist, and it is possible to transmit such impressions, in the form of electrical impulses, to a distance.  Here, at the receiving apparatus, the impulses could release from tanks or some such other apparatus liquids to simulate the transmitted taste impulses.  This is not impossible, but the whole thing would be the height of foolishness, because no one would want to do it, as the expense would be entirely too high.

It might be possible for a New York merchant in this way to taste the quality of Chinese tea 6,000 miles from New York, but why would he wish to do it after all?  And certainly, if he had to pay the cost of doing it, he probably would think twice before attempting it.

Coming back to television, what application this interesting invention will take in the future can only be dimly guessed at.  There was a time when we were talking first about radio telephony, when it was conceded by practically all of us who had a hand in the shaping of its destinies, that the logical thing would be talking by radio to our friends.  Thus in the first book ever written on the subject: "The Wireless Telephone," published by me in 1908, before there was a Radiotelephone, I could see only one use for the coming invention and that was a parallel to the wire telephone.  I did not dream of broadcasting, nor did any one else.[^wno]

The same may be said of television.  Right now we are glibly talking about television attachments on our telephones, and radio sets.  We may be all wrong, and the new art of television may turn into entirely different directions, undreamt of today.  Science has the habit of doing the unforeseen, and often throws our best and most logical predictions on the scrap heap.

[^wno]: Didn't Hugo have another editorial around the time of the broadcasting boom defending the wireless telegraph and the importance of learning code?  What does it actually say in his "Wireless Telephone" book about wireless telephony?

[^sns]:  Cite "Are New Senses Possible" in previous months' issue.  cite also "Modern Illusions" in the next month's issue on how science now deceives our senses.  How the "magic" of high technology and unseen electrical processes can induce affects that we shouldn't trust.
