Order the TOC not by strict chronology, but smear it a bit so that the articles are sequenced in the most readable fashion.  The books should be a condensation, a lens on a particular episteme, a moment in history.  What if there's a thematically organized TOC for a book that runs chronologically?  And that's the only TOC?  What would the "user experience" of this book be?

The subject index can give a little one-sentence or phrase blurb on each article, almost reveling in the pulpy, gaudy, attention-grabbing tone -- but one that highlights key questions in media studies.  Like:
