"we exploit the future"

=======================

In many ways, Gernsback's new fiction magazines didn't contain anything that hadn't already been introduced in one form or another by his earlier titles.  The future contined to be defended as a topic of serious discussion (**Our Cover**).  Fantastic fiction served as a means of describing and explaining present-day technologies.  The letter column hosted lively debates among readers, the importance of self-instruction was emphasized throughout, and Gernsback solicited "plots" from readers in the same way that he solicited "wrinkles, recipes, and formulas" in the technology magazines (**What to Invent**).  In the November 1929 issue of *Science Wonder Stories* for instance, he offers a prize of $150 in gold for story treatments: "…the more interesting, the more exciting, and *the more scientifically probable* you can make it, the better.  Remember, *anyone* can participate in this contest" (485).  The approach taken by *Modern Electrics, Electrical Experimenter, Science and Invention* and *Radio News* served as the blueprint for narrative works appearing in *Amazing Stories* and *Science Wonder Stories:*  extrapolate a technology of the future from given materials and describe its engineering specifications.  In stories by Abraham Merritt, Murray Leinster, and Philip Francis Nowlan, characters recede into the background as the pretense for setting a parade of gadgets in motion, endowing a field of inanimate objects with agency and conflict.[^bpq6]  

The teenaged Frank K. Kelly's "Exiles of Mars" (Wonder Stories Quarterly, Summer 1932) begins with a rundown of the latest research about conditions on the surface of Mars, and "The Moon Tragedy" (Wonder Stories, October 1933) describes in painstaking detail the fate of the last explorers on the moon, now marooned there.

Noordung, Hermann.  “The Problems of Space Flying.”  Science Wonder Stories, July-Sept 1929.  translated from the German orig., pub 1928.  “This was an astonishingly accurate and detailed consideration of the problems associated with humans living in space. The pioneering work being undertaken by German engineers into rocketry was feeding into German literature and Gernsback brought that expertise to America.” (Ashley 65)

The character in a work of scientifiction, in the words of Samuel R. Delany, is a "subject-that-doesn't-even-exist-without-objects."^[@delany_silent_1994, p. 200.]  It's for this reason that Gernsback, as late as the 1960s when science fiction was taking on far more socially and culturally complex topics, referred to Clement Fezandié as a "titan of science fiction"^[@gernsback_guest_1961].  Fezandié, author of the dry series of lectures masquerading as short stories "Doctor Hackensaw's Secrets", simply posits a technology, describes in minute detail how it works, and briefly explores why that technology will be economically and socially important.

[^bpq6]:  According to Sam Moskowitz, Gernsback's most important finds as an editor included Dr. David H. Keller, "the pioneer in what later was to become popular as 'psychological' science fiction stories; Edward E. Smith, the creator of the super-sceince tale; John W. Campbell, Jr.; Philip Francis Nowlan, whose stories of Anthony (Buck) Rogers ran in *Amazing Stories* some time before they appeared as a comic strip; Stanton A. Coblentz, poet and, in his fiction, magazine science fiction's best satirist in the tradition of Jonathan Swift; A. Hyatt Verrill, outstanding archaeologist; Fletcher Pratt, later celebrated naval writer; Harl Vincent, Bob Olsen, Miles J. Breuer, M.D., and Jack Williamson." @moskowitz_explorers_1963, p. 237.  Other notable authors published by Gernsback include Francis Flagg, Claire Winger Harris, the first regular female writer in the specialized SF magazines, R.F. Starzl, Edmond Hamilton, Abraham Merritt, and Murray Leinster.]

Gernsback's own short fiction perhaps best exemplifies this form.  **The Killing Flash** (1929) explores the idea that, with news, operas, and dramas now sent over the aiwaves, one might now be able to conduct a wireless murder.  A fictional apprentice to Nikola Tesla named Why Sparks devises a means of harmlessly disabling German weapons in **The Magnetic Storm** (1918), providing an imaginary resolution to the tensions of the Great War at its height.  And in the October 1915 installment of **The Scientific Adventures of Baron Münchhausen,** the Baron explains how he set up the very communications relay between Mars and the Earth that transmits the story to readers.  Much like the Baron, stringing electrical components together in order to tell a story, Gernsback was inventing the form of scientifiction as he wrote, altering the narrative's setting, tone, and emphasis over the course of his serial novels.^[Scientifiction was utilitarian not just in content but form as well.  One story has it that Gernsback's decision to write *Ralph* was an editorial stopgap in order to fill space in a *Modern Electrics* issue that was running short of its page quota.  @moskowitz_explorers_1963, p. 232.  @westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 98-99.]  It was sometime during the summer of 1911, for instance, that Gernsback first discovered Mark Wicks's utopia *To Mars via the Moon: An Astronomical Story* (1911).  According to Gary Westfahl, this encounter radically changed the course of *Ralph 124C 41+,* which had been running since the beginning of that year as a guided tour of the brilliant Ralph's amazing inventions and the marvelous future city in which he lived.  By the November 1911 installment, the narrative shifts drastically to an interplanetary space opera that included much more illustrations and footnotes, elements borrowed from Wick.^[Westfahl argues that the anonymous review of Wicks's book in the September 1911 issue of *Modern Electrics* was probably written by Gernsback.  The review refers to the Wicks text as a "scientific novel," according to Westfahl, "the first Gernsback-magazine use of a term for science fiction." @westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 101.]  Other generic influences included stock romantic intrigue borrowed from melodrama, "the colorful storylines of villainy, pursuit, and resurrection" from other contemporary popular fiction, and "his own emphasis on imagining and explaining at length new scientific achievements."^[@westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 105]  

So when we say that Hugo Gernsback was one of the first critical commentators on the genre of science fiction, we have to understand the word "critic" in a very specific sense.  Gernsback was primarily a technologist.  He "almost certainly never read any contemporary book reviews, literary magazines, prefaces to literary works, or critical studies, and he did not research such materials from previous eras."^[@westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 18.]  His observations on the nature of scientifiction were often honed through engagment with readers.  As John Cheng has shown, the publication of readers' letters in the pages of *Amazing Stories* allowed writers, editors, and readers to engage in a dialogue not only on science fiction, but a form of science itself that wasn't merely a passive spectator sport.  These dialogues built a popular consensus on what counted as scientific fact: 

> As they redefined the character of participation that publishers sought to create for them, readers' exchanges also reshaped the character of science within their writers' fiction and their editors' features, reading it with unanticipated intent and unintended consequence.  Science fiction's conversations not only fostered a community of readership, they imagined and reimagined science and fiction within the social dynamics and historical circumstances of the 1920s and 1930s.^[@cheng_astounding_2012, p. 78.]

One of these readers (and later contributor of the famous short story "The Man from the Atom"), G. Peyton Wertenbaker, offered perhaps one of the most eloquent of these letters.  Gernsback quotes Wertenbaker's letter in the editorial **Fiction Versus Facts** and attepts to answer his warning that if a writer attempts to capture the sublime (scientifiction being the only modern literature truly capable of approaching the sublime) through too rigorously objective of a lens, scientifiction could lose much of its power:

> Scientifiction goes out into the remote vistas of the universe, where there is still mystery and so still beauty. For that reason scientifiction seems to me to be the true literature of the future.

> The danger that may lie before *Amazing Stories* is that of becoming too scientific and not sufficiently literary. It is yet too early to be sure, but not too early for a warning to he issued amicably and frankly.

Ironically, Gernsback responds with an unfortunately mechanical formula:  "If we may voice our own opinion we should say the ideal proportion of a scientifiction story should be seventy-five per cent literature interwoven with twenty-five per cent science."  But already, one can see that the genre began as if forming itself around a problem to be solved.  As if anticipating Darko Suvin's highly influential definition of science fiction as a negotiation between "cognition," or empirical verifiablity, and "estrangement" from the author's given world, pulp practitioners were already thinking about how to marry technical complexity with fictional potency.^[@suvin_poetics_1972.]  This is reflected in the 1928 contest to design a logo for scientifiction and the image that resulted, with the dual cogs of "fact" and "theory" working in concert to ink the genre's name.  He describes the results:

> It was our aim to incorporate as much science as possible in the design, so the frame of the design, representing structural steel, suggests more machinery. The flashes in the central wheel represent Electricity. The top of the fountain pen is a test tube, which stands for Chemistry; while the background with the moon and stars and planet, give us the science of Astronomy.^[@gernsback_results_1928.]

![Frank R. Paul's original illustration of a logo for scientifiction, based on suggestion by readers A.A. Kaufman of Brooklyn, NY, Clarence Beck of West Bend, WI, and A.J. Jacobson of Duluth, MN.  Courtesy, collection of Jim and Felicia Kreuzer, Grand Island, NY.](images/sf_logo_original.png)

Gernsback's most programmatic definitions of the science fiction genre (**A New Sort of Magazine; The Lure of Scientifiction; How to Write 'Science' Stories**), end up muddling in different proportions the category of "fact" with what he variously describes as "fiction," "imagination," and "fantasy."  One might consider "fact" to be a matter of the past tense and "fiction" as having a certain future-directedness.  Donna Harraway outlines the distinction:

> Fiction's kinship to facts is close, but they are not identical twins.  Facts are opposed to opinion, to prejudice, but not to fiction.  Both fiction and fact are rooted in an epistemology that appeals to experience.  However, there is an important difference; the word *fiction* is an active form, referring to a present act of fashioning, while *fact* is a descendant of a past participle, a word form which masks the generative deed or performance.  A fact seems done, unchangeable, fit only to be recorded; fiction seems always inventive, open to other possibilities, other fashionings of life.  But in this opening lies the threat of merely feigning, of not telling the true form of things.^[@haraway_primate_1990, p. 4.]

Gernsback of course demanded that the works of scientifiction he published be sufficiently plausible (**Reasonableness in Science Fiction**), but he had an unusually high tolerance for what constituted the plausible.  Receiving criticism as early as *Electrical Experimenter* for lending "so much space to the exploitation of the future," Gernsback argues that progress makes anything possible with time.  "We are fully aware of the fact that some of the imaginary articles which we publish are wildly extravagant---now.  But are we so sure that they will be extravagant fifty years from now?  It is never safe in these days of rapid progress to call any one thing impossible or even improbable" (**Imagination Versus Fact**).^[Readers responded favorably to Gernsback's defense.  As one put it:  “I have been more or less narrow-minded myself.  I could not see, for the life of me, why it was that the editor continued the story of the ‘Baron Münchausen’s Scientific Adventures,’ but after reading a few installments I began to look at improbabilities with the far distant view of probability.”  @norstadt_[letter]_1916.]  This leads to the strange idea embedded in the *Baron Münchhausen* story included here, that "there is no fiction":

> If, as often---no, always---has been proved that the most violent fiction at some time or other invariably comes true, then by all proceeds of modern logic, there cannot be such thing as fiction. It simply does not exist. This brings us face to face with the startling result that if fiction always comes true some time or other, why then, bless their dear souls, all fiction writers must be prophets!!

This is no small point, in fact several literary theorists have argued that all fiction is in fact a subspecies/subgenre of science fiction, with fiction dealing with degrees of difference from the "real" world.[^bp2d]

[^bp2d]:  Carl Freedman writes: 

	> As we argue that the qualities that govern texts universally agreed to be science fiction can be found to govern other texts as well, it may be difficult to see just where the argument will stop. It may even begin to appear that ultimately nearly *all* fiction---perhaps even including realism itself---will be found to be science fiction. Does not that conclusion preclude success in defining science fiction as a recognizable *kind* of fiction? In fact, I do believe that all fiction is, in a sense, science fiction. It is even salutary, I think, sometimes to put the matter in more deliberately provocative, paradoxical form, and to maintain that fiction is a subcategory of science fiction rather than the other way around.

	@freedman_critical_2000, p. 16.  [[SEE ALSO CHU, ANDROIDS?]]

In **Science Fiction Versus Science Faction,** Gernsback outlines a spectrum of the fantastic, including the "probable, possible, and near-impossible."  Scientifiction touches on all of these, but the best works in the genre are "prophetic," able to slide along the continuum as its real world referents change.  These works mutate with time, shifting in parallax with historical developments in the real world and gradually aging from works of science fiction into "science faction," losing their imaginative charge and simply becoming lists of facts.  As if science fiction is a genre with a half-life, a particular quality of works that decays over time from prophetic vision to "mundane fiction."

192202_10k_years -- an article on the horizon of predictability for the "up-to-date scientist," then jumps 10,000 years to show just how good of a prophet HG is, perhaps.  Future truths will surpass today's wildest "fiction" or fantasies.

19302_how_to_write -- scientific apparatus and methods are like clouds: the background, the setting of fiction.  And successful scientifiction writing requires research.  Also, first article in which HG uses the phrase "science fiction" (at least in this collection).  [[use to transition to imagination as invention]]

imagination as invention

------------------------------

Imagination as invention -- Senarens "invented" submarines, in **An American Jules Verne.**

192308_predicting_inventions -- Invention considered as a form of prophecy:  Working over the abstract idea of something that doesn't exist (what Chu calls the "cognitively estranging referent") using the raw material of hope and the imagination.  This leads to the strange idea that the inventor of the automobile wasn't Ford or ……… but nineteenth century approximators who constructed steam-powered prototypes of what they would later "know" to be the automobile:  "inventors over 150 years back knew the automobile."  So too is Verne seen as quite literally inventing the submarine, Leonardo da Vinci the steam engine and breech-loading gun, and Roger Bacon the telescope and gun powder (see "Lure of Scientifiction").  This is the essay where the idea of "exploiting the future" comes into play

192610_imagination_and_reality -- Gernsback's emphasis on the signature of scientifiction shifts in this editorial, away from objectively verifiable probability (as in **"Fiction Versus Facts"**) and toward an inspiration to future invention, no matter how seemingly fantastic. Given the fact that the wonders we've seen in the past years, the argument goes, the prophecies of the past that have seemingly been fulfilled, one would be a fool to dismiss anything as impossible.  He does, however, in this editorial, separate the author (stimulus) from the inventor (realization).  So, again, a slightly different version here.  How does it square with the idea above that invention works through a series of mistakes (a mousetrap is really a good burglar alarm?)

But what is the "truth" of "The Moon Hoax", included in the canon? This is verifiably false yet counted as charming and imaginative. Gernsback clarifies the difference a bit in "Science Fiction Versus Science Faction." An economy by which (prophetic) fiction is transformed into (scientific) fact.  The Moon Hoax isn't prophetic scientifiction, because it didn't become fact.  Only the best does.

	[[not yet deleted from **Editorially Speaking**: Among this issue's stories was "The Moon Hoax": reprints of articles published by the *New York Sun* throughout August 1835 that erroneously claimed the astronomer Sir John Herschel had recently discovered vegetation, animals, and an intelligent species that built temples on the moon.  The editorial introduction states that it was due to a lack of modern media that the hoax spread so easily to an incredulous public:  "At that time, when there were no cables and no radio, and communication was slow, it was a simple matter to spring such a hoax, where today it would not last twenty-four hours, because verification or denial would speedily be brought about."  Despite the series' obvious falsehood, this intro calls it "a charming story that will live forever … this remains one of the finest pieces of imagination that has ever appeared."  Thus the ever expanding catalogue of scientifiction "classics" included texts that worked upon the reader with a semblance of scientific veracity.  But the mark of a truly modern work of scientifiction was the speed with which the truth of the story could be proven or disproven by the community.]]

[[good 19th C transition to next section]]

19th C, race, women

---------------------------

As Gary Westfahl has persuasively argued, Gernsback not only set up the conditions in which a genre of science fiction could flourish, he also referenced and republished the work of nineteenth century authors in an attempt to establish a tradition upon which it could build.  In addition to his appreciation for Luis Senarens (**An American Jules Verne**) and Clement Fezandié (**Predicting Future Inventions**), Gernsback reprinted stories by Richard Adams Locke and Fitz James O'Brien.  Frequently mentioned nineteenth century authors mentioned in the pages of *Amazing* included H. Rider Haggard, Edward Bellamy, Garrett P. Serviss, M.P. Shiel, and Arthur Conan Doyle.  Contrary to later histories of proto-SF that emphasized texts commenting on the social or political context from which they emerged, Gernsback's nineteenth-century canon revolved around prognostication.  Westfahl: 

> In associating writers whose careers began in the 19th century with SF, Gernsback, unlike later historians, did not attribute their work to larger events in that era; they were rather persons ahead of their time, 'prophets' who anticipated both the value of scientific progress and the value of literature about scientific progress.  All on his own, Poe 'conceive[d] the idea of a scientific story.'  Thus, according to Gernsback, 19th-century SF was simply the product of isolated individual geniuses.^[@westfahl_jules_1992, p. 242-3, citing **The Lure of Scientifiction.**]

Using this definition of scientifiction as a "prophetic vision" of future machines and inventions "that were only to materialize centuries later," Gernsback argues that scientifiction can be traced all the way back to Leonardo Da Vinci and Francis Bacon (**The Lure of Scientifiction**).  Contrary to claims that the genre definitively began in 1926 with the introduction of *Amazing Stories,* these pieces make it clear that a very sophisticated understanding of the genre's roots as both deep and broad was already in place by the 1910s.  For instance, in a 1915 satirical patent application for a wearable apparatus for bookworms who would read both day and night, the illustration depicts an insatiable reader holding a copy of *Deadwood Dick,* suggesting that Gernsback and his colleagues were aware of an even broader tradition upon which they built (**Phoney Patent Offizz: Bookworm’s Nurse**).  *Deadwood Dick* was a series of dime novel westerns written by Edward L. Wheeler from 1877-1885, and under ghostwriters from 1886-1897.^[Wheeler "wore a Stetson hat, and is said to have greeted even strangers as 'pard.'"  @johannsen_house_1950, available online at Northern Illinois University Libraries's Beadle and Adams Dime Novel Digitization Project, <http://www.ulib.niu.edu/badndp/>.]  Dime novels serve as an important precursor to magazine era science fiction both materially---printed on very cheap paper and "sent to the army in the field by cords, like unsaved firewood" during the American Civil War---and thematically---featuring stories of marvels, lost races, and inventions like Edward S. Ellis's *Steam Man of the Prairies.*^[See @jencks_dime_1904; @bleiler_newark_1989.]

"Modern" scientifiction is distinguished from older by the speed with which a fantastic idea could be proven or disproven, through communications media.  footnote in **Editorially Speaking**

Writing SF stories as craft, and anonymous craftspeople who refered to themselves as writers rather than authors (Cheng).

Though dime novels and the popular pulp magazines that followed were the product of 'a revolution in industrial mass production that capitalized on North America’s vastly increased immigrant population, its decline in illiteracy rates, its rural postal delivery, and its increased urbanization,” the thinly drawn "enemies" were almost always signaled through ethnic markers.^[@ross_strange_1991, p. 106]  Everett F. Bleiler, in his entry on the dime novel in the *Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,* writes:

    

> Stress was on iron technology, with little or no science; narratives contained random, thrilling incidents, often presented in a disjointed and puerile way. Typical social patterns were: a conscious attempt to capitalize on age conflict, with boy inventors outdoing their elders (Edisonade); aggressive, exploitative capitalism, particularly at the expense of "primitive" peoples; the frontier mentality, with slaughter of "primitives" (in the first Frank Reade, Jr. story Frank kills about 250 Native Americans, to say nothing of destroying an inhabited village); strong elements of sadism; ethnic rancour focused on Native Americans, blacks, Irish and, later, Mexicans and Jews.^[@bleiler_dime-novel_2014.]

![](images/deadwood_dick_cover.jpg) <!-- no figure -->

These nineteenth-century writers championed by Gernsback were often known only by a penname, which means that writers and readers could do interesting things with identity.  Luis Senarens (1863-1939) was an exception to this rule, a Brooklyn-based Cuban American, was one of the few dime novel authors to be known by his given name, beyond the pseudonym he published under: "Noname."  Considering Samuel R. Delany's comments on what we lose along with authorial identities in the history of science fiction, Senarens's background is especially interesting:

> I believe I first heard Harlan Ellison make the point that we know of dozens upon dozens of early pulp writers only as names: They conducted their careers entirely by mail---in a field and during an era when pen names were the rule rather than the exception.  Among the 'Remington C. Scotts' and the 'Frank P. Joneses' who litter the contents pages of the early pulps, we simply have no way of knowing if one, three, or seven of them---or even many more---were blacks, Hispanics, women, Native Americans, Asians, or whatever.  Writing is like that.^[@delany_racism_2000.]

It would be nice if Senarens could prove the exception to this rule.  Much like Lisa Yaszek's work on the hundreds of female authors (many publishing under male pen names) for whom writing science fiction in postwar suburban America was "virtually the only vehicle of political dissent," one wishes that Senarens as a Cuban author could shed light on marginalized communities that participated (as editors, readers, storytellers) in the otherwise suffocatingly white male world of dime novel---and later pulp---fiction.^[@yaszek_galactic_2008, p. 3, quoting Judith Merril.]  Unfortunately, Senarens's work is in fact a distillation of the absolute worst tendencies of the dime novels' virulent racism and gleeful violence.  E.F. Bleiler's catalogue barely scratches the surface: "sadism, a rancorous disparaging of all races with the exception of WASPS, factual ignorance, coarse imperialist clichés about Manifest Destiny and the right of the White Man to rule the world."^[@bleiler_senarens_2014]

Of course, as a genre writer, one's work must inherently fit within a given paradigm.  But take, for instance, Senarens's first Reade title, *Frank Reade, Jr. and His Steam Wonder,* in which the teenaged protagonist and his friends (including Pomp, "the darkey who had accompanied Frank Reade, Sr., on so many of his wild escapades") massacre two hundred Native Americans in minutes, circling around the group in the Steam Wonder, a tank armed with repeating rifles and cannons that shoot boiling water.  When it is done, they "rejoice":

> "Hanged if that doesn't clear the field!" cried Sam Watson, in the greatest glee.  "The whole gang is busted!"

> "Yes," remarked Jack, "we can lick a thousand as well as a hundred, for they can't get in, you know."

> Why in thunder and chain lightning don't Uncle Sam buy a lot of these machines, and run 'em out here?" demanded Watson.  "They'd clear the plains of red-skins so quick it would make their heads swim.^[@senarens_frank_1893, p. 15.]

The dime novel paradigm is a precursor that many histories of science fiction would gladly speed past.  But one wonders the degree to which this predecessor is still with the genre, considering just how many of us have played out the exact tactics of Senarens's Steam Wonder tank scenario in SF-themed first person shooter video games.

John Rieder has persuasively argued in *Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction* that interplanetary invasion narratives common in the 1920s and 30s invoked the specters of colonial encounters between different cultures at the time.  In a mirror image of colonial encounters on Earth, stories confront white male heroes with civilizations and individuals far more advanced than anything they have seen before.  Within these stories

> lurks the possibility of finding oneself reduced by someone else’s progress to the helplessness of those who are unable to inhabit the present fully, and whose continued existence on any terms other than those of the conquerors has been rendered an archaism and anomaly.  Colonial invasion is the dark counter-image of technological revolution.  In relation to technology, as in other contexts, the history, ideology, and discourses of colonialism dovetail with the crucial, double perspective that runs throughout the genre:  on one hand, the wondrous exploration of the new and the marvelous encounter with the strange, but on he other, the post-apocalyptic vision of a world gone disastrously wrong.”^[@rieder_colonialism_2008, p. 32-3.]

While Gernsback stays remarkably silent on all issues regarding race, class, and gender, one would imagine in an effort to avoid alienating any potential subscribers, he was not entirely above the discourse of race and otherness that pervaded early science fiction.  For example, though the Martians have technologies far beyond the understanding even of Ralph, and are far more advanced than huamns in every way, the Martian villain of *Ralph,* Ferdinand, who runs off with the helpless Alice 212B 423 is described as "black, he was black all over."^[Ralph asks a store clerk for more details about Ferdinand's face, which he initially says was black but then concedes it was "covered with a black cloth." (165)]

So when we ask whose future is at stake here, whose future is being imagined, often it seems that the “universal” language of science was meant for white men and boys only.  “In particular, this language functioned as a mark of the heroes’ superiority in coping with conditions in exotic localities like Mars or Venus, whose climates were simply displaced from the popular action-adventure regions of the arid West and tropical Africa respectively.”^[@ross_strange_1991, p. 111.]  Women weren't exempt from this exclusion either -- or, sometimes inclusion among a marketplace of paying subscribers became a means of exclusion.  Gernsback, for instance, defends the title Amazing Stories over “Scientifiction,” because it might frighten off people who would otherwise be interested in the type of fiction offered.  The title is “the best one to influence the masses, because anything that smacks of science seems to be too ‘deep’ for the average type of reader.”  This title important not only to attract “the masses,” but women as well, who Gernsback is happy to report are reading the magazine. 

> A totally unforeseen result of the name, strange to say, was that a great many women are already reading the new magazine.  This is most encouraging. We know that they must have picked up AMAZING STORIES out of curiosity more than anything else, and found it to their liking, and we are certain that if the name of the magazine had been "Scientifiction," they would not have been attracted to it at a newsstand.  (**Editorially Speaking**)

The question, of course, became why it is that women wouldn't be drawn to magazines on science.  A similar debate over the identity and construction of scientifiction broke out among readers when *Science Wonder Stories* simplified its name to *Wonder Stories* in June 1930.  And just as it does here, the conversation insidiously conflated genre and gender.  John Cheng writes, 

> readers' responses were swift, heated, and divided.  Those readers interested in science fiction's science were appalled.  'Your aim, I take it, is to make the title more "catchy,"' wrote Lloyd E. Foltz of Indianapolis, Indiana, 'to that class of magazine addicts who are already reading, "Sappy Stories," "Slushy Romances," and so on, ad nauseam.'  He argued that the changes betrayed science fiction's premise.  'I believe this is a mistake,' he said.  'It will attract a type of reader to whom S. A. means sex appeal and not scientific adventure.'  Other readers disagreed.  'Now for the burden that some of the readers seem to carry---romance,' wrote Darrel Richards, 8620 Hamilton Avenue, Detroit Michigan.  'Why shouldn't "females" … be included in the science fiction stories?' he asked.  'Remember, "Love makes the world go around."'^[@cheng_astounding_2012, 116.]

Justine Larbalestier points out that in many conversations on genre among readers, "the terms 'love interest,' 'romance,' 'sex,' and 'women' are used interchageably.  They become one and the same.  On the whole this equivalence between 'women' and 'love interest' disqualifies women from the field of science fiction, since love belongs to the field of romance" (10).  An argument for minimizing the presence of romance elements in the scientifiction genre thus becomes---in some cases explicitly---about marginalizing women.^[For an account of a late 1930s debate among readers of *Astounding Science Fiction* that typifies this equivalency between genre and gender, (including an eighteen-year-old Isaac Asmiov who writes, "When we want science-fiction, we don't want swooning dames, and that goes double. … Come on, men, make yourself heard in favor of less love mixed with our science!"), see @larbalestier_battle_2002, 117-135.  Larbalestier provides readings of women SF writers as well, including Claire Winger Harris, the first regular female writer in the SF magazines, and Leslie F. Stone, whose story "The Conquest of Gola" in *Wonder Stories* April 1931 issue thematized the "battle of the sexes."]  One reader, Mary Byers of Springfield, OH, in a response to Asimov that Larbalestier argues echoes later feminist science fiction critics like Joanna Russ, writes:  "To his plea for less hooey I give my whole-hearted support, but less hooey does not mean less women; it means a difference in the way they are introduced into the story and the part they play." @byers_other_1938.  What's interesting though, is the way in which the very structure of SF actually ended up giving women a way into an arena they were formerly excluded from.  The rules of that supposedly masculine genre allowed it to call into question the hard and fixed gender norms enforced by many readers.

"science" and wonder

-----------------------------

Being taught without knowing it.  Wonder vs. technical knowledge.

> In the early years of pulp science fiction magazines in the 1920s and 1930s there are not many letters that discuss what science fiction or scientifiction is.  Everyone knew what ‘it’ was — it had something to do with ‘science’ — but everyone seemed to have a different notion of what constituted ‘science,’ what does and does not belong to the universe of science fiction and who has the rights to make these decisions.  What science fiction is, the genre, is taken for granted in the letters, but the texts, the instances of this genre, are not so defined, so that attempts to limit the field become a series of test cases about which there is not always agreement.^[@larbalestier_battle_2002, 33.]

See Larbalestier section, “the science in science fiction,” 31-38

“For interwar science fiction, ‘amazing,’ ‘astounding,’ and ‘wonder’ were more than magazine titles; they were also metaphors for a specific style to imagine science, clarion calls for its conversation.  … Gernsback developed a view of participatory science before he began his science fiction ventures…” @cheng_astounding_2012

See next 192310 “The New Science and Invention” on how he sees the magazine’s role in popular science

	"The reason is that the average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of text of scientific facts, which means concentration and study. With fiction, however, this does not hold true because fiction is an entertainment; it does not require study. On the other hand, *we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study.*"

**Are We Intelligent,** cites the information overload for everyday people w/ modern technology, and that S&I is designed to match the speed with which people disseminate information now.  A very familiar sounding approach now, with digestible news stories and the time to read listed in the header, etc.  Magazine as a medium for educating an overwhelmed public.  Nice closing gesture to today, and the speed at which Gernsback's ideas moved.

End with a comment on how HG was an educator, wanted to educate the public in science, his magazines meant to do that.  Will be a nice lead-in to "How to Read This Book" section.

"Science," wrote Gernsback in the inaugural issue of *Amazing Stories*,

> through its various branches of mechanics, astronomy, etc., enters so intimately into all our lives today, and we are so much immersed in this science, that we have become rather prone to take new inventions and discoveries for granted. Our entire mode of living has been changed with the present progress, and it is little wonder, therefore, that many fantastic situations [...] are brought about today. It is in these situations that the new romancers find their great inspiration. (**"A New Sort of Magazine"** (1926))

@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 320, "scientifiction" seems like it was very much a marketing idea, with other magazines responding in editorials that their stories *weren't* pseudo-scientific.  Like Argosy and Weird Tales.
