"we exploit the future": Scientifiction's Debut

======================================

In many ways, Gernsback's new fiction magazines didn't contain anything that hadn't already been introduced in one form or another by his technical titles.  The future continued to be defended as a topic of serious discussion (**Our Cover**).  Fantastic fiction served as a means of describing and explaining present-day technologies.  The letter column hosted lively debates among readers, the importance of self-instruction was emphasized throughout, and Gernsback invited "plots" from readers in a manner similar to the "wrinkles, recipes, and formulas" solicited by the technology magazines (**What to Invent**).  In the November 1929 issue of *Science Wonder Stories* for instance, he offers a prize of $150 in gold for story treatments:  "the more interesting, the more exciting, and *the more scientifically probable* you can make it, the better.  Remember, *anyone* can participate in this contest" (485).  The approach taken by *Modern Electrics, Electrical Experimenter, Science and Invention* and *Radio News* served as the blueprint for narrative works appearing in *Amazing Stories* and *Science Wonder Stories:*  extrapolate a technology of the future from given materials and describe its engineering specifications.  The "story" itself was almost of secondary concern.  In A. Hyatt Verrill's "The Man Who Could Vanish," for instance, the narrator prepares the reader for the amount of technical detail that will follow in a tale of invisibility technology:

> To many readers much of this matter will, no doubt, prove rather dry, and, if I were writing fiction, I would omit all those portions of the tale which deal with the scientific side and the preliminaries.  But both Dr. Unsinn and myself feel that to omit such matters would be a great mistake, and that as the story is of as much interest and importance to the scientific world as to the layman, nothing should be left untold.  Moreover, we feel that unless such matters were included my story would be considered as purely fictitious.  And at any rate the reader is at liberty to skip such portions of my narrative as the appreciative reader may find to be lacking in real and genuine interest.

In stories by Abraham Merritt, Murray Leinster, and Philip Francis Nowlan, characters similarly recede into the background as the pretense for setting a parade of gadgets in motion, endowing a field of inanimate objects with agency and conflict.[^bpq6]  The character in a work of scientifiction, in the words of Samuel R. Delany, is a "subject-that-doesn't-even-exist-without-objects."^[@delany_silent_1994, p. 200.]  It's for this reason that Gernsback, as late as the 1960s when science fiction was taking on far more socially and culturally complex topics, referred to Clement Fezandié as a "titan of science fiction"^[@gernsback_guest_1961].  Fezandié, author of the dry series of lectures masquerading as short stories "Doctor Hackensaw's Secrets", simply posits a technology, describes in minute detail how it works, and briefly explores why that technology will be economically and socially important.

[^bpq6]:  According to Sam Moskowitz, Gernsback's most important finds as an editor included Dr. David H. Keller, author of a ten-volume *Sexual Education Series* later published by Gernsback and "the pioneer in what later was to become popular as 'psychological' science fiction stories; Edward E. Smith, the creator of the super-science tale; John W. Campbell, Jr.; Philip Francis Nowlan, whose stories of Anthony (Buck) Rogers ran in *Amazing Stories* some time before they appeared as a comic strip; Stanton A. Coblentz, poet and, in his fiction, magazine science fiction's best satirist in the tradition of Jonathan Swift; A. Hyatt Verrill, outstanding archaeologist; Fletcher Pratt, later celebrated naval writer; Harl Vincent, Bob Olsen, Miles J. Breuer, M.D., and Jack Williamson." @moskowitz_explorers_1963, p. 237.  Other notable writers published by Gernsback include Francis Flagg, Claire Winger Harris, the first regular female writer in the specialized SF magazines, R.F. Starzl, Edmond Hamilton, Abraham Merritt, and Murray Leinster.

Gernsback's own short fiction perhaps best exemplifies this form.  **The Killing Flash** (1929) explores the idea that, with news, operas, and dramas now sent over the airwaves, one might now be able to conduct a wireless murder.  A fictional apprentice to Nikola Tesla named Why Sparks devises a means of harmlessly disabling German weapons in **The Magnetic Storm** (1918), providing an imaginary resolution to the tensions of the Great War at its height.  And in the October 1915 installment of **The Scientific Adventures of Baron Münchhausen,** the Baron explains how he set up the very communications relay between Mars and the Earth that transmits his story to readers.  Much like the Baron, stringing electrical components together in order to tell a story, Gernsback was inventing the form of scientifiction as he wrote, altering the narrative's setting, tone, and emphasis over the course of his serial novels.^[Scientifiction was utilitarian not just in content but form as well.  One story has it that Gernsback's decision to write *Ralph* was an editorial stopgap in order to fill space in a *Modern Electrics* issue that was running short of its page quota.  @moskowitz_explorers_1963, p. 232.  @westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 98-99.]  It was sometime during the summer of 1911, for instance, that Gernsback first discovered Mark Wicks's utopia *To Mars via the Moon: An Astronomical Story* (1911).  According to Gary Westfahl, this encounter radically changed the course of *Ralph 124C 41+,* which had been running since the beginning of that year as a guided tour of the brilliant Ralph's amazing inventions and the marvelous future city in which he lived.  By the November 1911 installment, the narrative shifts drastically to an interplanetary space opera that included much more illustrations and footnotes, elements borrowed from Wick.^[Westfahl argues that the anonymous review of Wicks's book in the September 1911 issue of *Modern Electrics* was probably written by Gernsback.  The review refers to the Wicks text as a "scientific novel," according to Westfahl, "the first Gernsback-magazine use of a term for science fiction." @westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 101.]  Other generic influences included stock romantic intrigue borrowed from melodrama, "the colorful storylines of villainy, pursuit, and resurrection" from other contemporary popular fiction, and "his own emphasis on imagining and explaining at length new scientific achievements."^[@westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 105]  

So when we say that Hugo Gernsback was one of the first critical commentators on the genre of science fiction, we have to understand the word "critic" in a very specific sense.  Gernsback was primarily a technologist.  He "almost certainly never read any contemporary book reviews, literary magazines, prefaces to literary works, or critical studies, and he did not research such materials from previous eras."^[@westfahl_hugo_2007, p. 18.]  Unlike the insularity of many literary critical debates, his arguments about the nature of scientifiction were honed through engagement with its readers.  As John Cheng has shown, the publication of readers' letters in the pages of *Amazing Stories* allowed writers, editors, and readers to engage in a dialogue not only on scientifiction, but a form of science itself that wasn't merely a passive spectator sport.  These dialogues built a popular consensus on what counted as scientific fact: 

> As they redefined the character of participation that publishers sought to create for them, readers' exchanges also reshaped the character of science within their writers' fiction and their editors' features, reading it with unanticipated intent and unintended consequence.  Science fiction's conversations not only fostered a community of readership, they imagined and reimagined science and fiction within the social dynamics and historical circumstances of the 1920s and 1930s.^[@cheng_astounding_2012, p. 78.  Justine Larbalestier agrees on this point:  "In the early years of pulp science fiction magazines in the 1920s and 1930s there are not many letters that discuss what science fiction or scientifiction is.  Everyone knew what ‘it’ was---it had something to do with ‘science’---but everyone seemed to have a different notion of what constituted ‘science,’ what does and does not belong to the universe of science fiction and who has the rights to make these decisions.  What science fiction is, the genre, is taken for granted in the letters, but the texts, the instances of this genre, are not so defined, so that attempts to limit the field become a series of test cases about which there is not always agreement.  @larbalestier_battle_2002, 33.]

One of these readers (and later contributor of the famous short story "The Man from the Atom"), G. Peyton Wertenbaker, offered perhaps one of the most eloquent of these letters.  Gernsback quotes Wertenbaker's letter in the editorial **Fiction Versus Facts** and attempts to answer his warning that if a writer attempts to capture the sublime through too rigorously objective of a lens (scientifiction being the only modern literature truly capable of approaching the sublime), scientifiction could lose much of its power:

> Scientifiction goes out into the remote vistas of the universe, where there is still mystery and so still beauty. For that reason scientifiction seems to me to be the true literature of the future.

> The danger that may lie before *Amazing Stories* is that of becoming too scientific and not sufficiently literary. It is yet too early to be sure, but not too early for a warning to he issued amicably and frankly.

Ironically, Gernsback responds with a completely mechanical formula:  "If we may voice our own opinion we should say the ideal proportion of a scientifiction story should be seventy-five per cent literature interwoven with twenty-five per cent science."  Nevertheless, one can see here that the genre began forming itself around a problem to be solved.  As if anticipating Darko Suvin's highly influential definition of science fiction as a negotiation between "cognition," or empirical verifiability, and degrees of "estrangement" from the author's given world, pulp practitioners were already thinking in their own way about how to marry technical complexity with fictional potency.^[@suvin_poetics_1972.]  Technocratic solutions to this problem in poetics were of course favored, as we can see from the 1928 *Amazing Stories* contest to design a logo for scientifiction and the image that resulted, with its dual cogs of "fact" and "theory" working in lock step to automatically ink the genre's name.  Gernsback describes the results of the contest:

> It was our aim to incorporate as much science as possible in the design, so the frame of the design, representing structural steel, suggests more machinery. The flashes in the central wheel represent Electricity. The top of the fountain pen is a test tube, which stands for Chemistry; while the background with the moon and stars and planet, give us the science of Astronomy.^[@gernsback_results_1928.]

What precisely counts as "fact" and "theory" (the latter category is also referred to as "fiction," "imagination," and "fantasy") in Gernsback's most programmatic definitions of the science fiction genre (**A New Sort of Magazine; The Lure of Scientifiction; How to Write 'Science' Stories**) changes with time, and he mixes the categories in different proportions.  Gernsback of course demanded that the works of scientifiction he published be sufficiently plausible (**Reasonableness in Science Fiction**), but he had an unusually high tolerance for what constituted plausibility.  Receiving criticism as early as *Electrical Experimenter* for lending "so much space to the exploitation of the future," Gernsback argues that progress makes anything possible with time.  "We are fully aware of the fact that some of the imaginary articles which we publish are wildly extravagant---now.  But are we so sure that they will be extravagant fifty years from now?  It is never safe in these days of rapid progress to call any one thing impossible or even improbable" (**Imagination Versus Fact**).^[Readers responded favorably to Gernsback's defense.  As one put it:  “I have been more or less narrow-minded myself.  I could not see, for the life of me, why it was that the editor continued the story of the ‘Baron Münchausen’s Scientific Adventures,’ but after reading a few installments I began to look at improbabilities with the far distant view of probability.”  @norstadt_letter_1916.]  This simultaneous faith in technological progress and sense of satisfaction that the present day has fulfilled the utopian dreams of the past leads to a strange idea embedded in the *Baron Münchhausen* installment included here, that there is no fiction:

> If, as often---no, always---has been proved that the most violent fiction at some time or other invariably comes true, then by all proceeds of modern logic, there cannot be such thing as fiction. It simply does not exist. This brings us face to face with the startling result that if fiction always comes true some time or other, why then, bless their dear souls, all fiction writers must be prophets!!

All fiction is in this sense "true," be it the most seemingly unrealistic or the description of the most mundane day-to-day occurrences.  This is no small point, evoking the argument of several contemporary literary theorists who see all fiction to be in fact a subgenre of science fiction.  If science fiction deals in degrees of difference from the "real" world, realistic or literary fiction then exists at a specific point on the spectrum of variation from the real.[^bp2d]

[^bp2d]:  Carl Freedman writes: 

	> As we argue that the qualities that govern texts universally agreed to be science fiction can be found to govern other texts as well, it may be difficult to see just where the argument will stop. It may even begin to appear that ultimately nearly *all* fiction---perhaps even including realism itself---will be found to be science fiction. Does not that conclusion preclude success in defining science fiction as a recognizable *kind* of fiction? In fact, I do believe that all fiction is, in a sense, science fiction. It is even salutary, I think, sometimes to put the matter in more deliberately provocative, paradoxical form, and to maintain that fiction is a subcategory of science fiction rather than the other way around.

	@freedman_critical_2000, p. 16.  Seo-Young Chu also touches on this idea in the opening section to -@chu_metaphors_2010.

Gernsback follows this line of thought in **Science Fiction Versus Science Faction,** where he outlines a spectrum of the fantastic that includes the "probable, possible, and near-impossible."  A given story's horizon of predictability is dependent on the technical expertise of the writer, who must be an "up-to-date scientist" (**10,000 Years Hence**).  Crafting an important work of scientificiton thus involves more of the mind of a technologist than a literary writer, as we see in a piece he wrote for *Writer's Digest,* **How to Write 'Science' Stories.**  Of paramount importance is "description," and to make that description interesting for the reader:  "What description of clouds and sunsets was to the old novelist, description of scientific apparatus and methods is to the modern" scientifiction writer.  The very best works in the genre are "prophetic," and slide along the continuum of plausibility as its real world referents change.  These works mutate with time, shifting in parallax with historical developments and gradually aging from works of science fiction into what he calls "science faction," losing their imaginative charge as they become simple lists of facts.  Much like the gradually decaying futures haunting the protagonist of William Gibson's short story "The Gernsback Continuum," one of scientifiction's signature characteristics is that its works have a half life.[^gbsn]  There is some particular quality that decays over time from prophetic vision to what SF writers today refer to as the realism that exists outside of the genre: "mundane fiction."

[^gbsn]: "I'd say you saw a semiotic ghost.  All these contactee stories, for instance, are framed in a kind of sci-fi imagery that permeates our culture.  I could buy aliens, but not aliens that look like Fifties' comic art.  They're semiotic phantoms, bits of deep cultural imagery that have split off and taken on a life of their own, like the Jules Verne airships that those old Kansas farmers were always seeing.  But you saw a different kind of ghost, that's all.  That plane was part of the mass unconscious, once.  You picked up on that, somehow.  The important thing is not to worry about it."  @gibson_gernsback_1981.

Given the high degree of technical detail scientifiction writers engaged in, Gernsback often referred to imagination as a form of invention.  In this sense, Luis Senarens literally "invented" the submarine when he described it in a nineteenth-century story (**An American Jules Verne**).  So too did Leonardo da Vinci "invent" the breech-loading gun and Roger Bacon the telescope (**The Lure of Scientifiction**).  Likewise, the automobile was invented by eighteenth century approximators who constructed steam-powered prototypes of what would later evolve into the modern car:  "inventors over 150 years back *knew* the automobile" (**Predicting Future Inventions**).  But "modern" scientifiction is distinguished from these older forms of technical prophecy by the speed with which a fantastic idea could be proven through communications media.  Among the fiction in the September 1926 issue of *Amazing Stories* was "The Moon Hoax," a reprint of a series of articles published by the *New York Sun* throughout August 1835 that erroneously claimed the astronomer Sir John Herschel had recently discovered vegetation, animals, and an intelligent species that built temples on the moon.  The editorial introduction to the story states that it was due to a lack of modern media that the hoax spread so easily to an incredulous public:  

> At that time, when there were no cables and no radio, and communication was slow, it was a simple matter to spring such a hoax, where today it would not last twenty-four hours, because verification or denial would speedily be brought about.

"The Moon Hoax," a "charming story that will live for ever . . . [and] one of the finest pieces of imagination that has ever appeared," nevertheless by Gernsback's standards for modern scientifiction fell short not only because it didn't end up becoming fact, but also because it couldn't participate in the economy by which prophetic scientifiction is translated into fact:  debated, proven, or disproven by a networked community of afficionados.

The nineteenth century nevertheless provided an endless source of inspiration for Gernsback and his writers.  As Gary Westfahl has persuasively argued, Gernsback not only set up the conditions in which a genre of science fiction could flourish, he also referenced and republished the work of nineteenth century authors in an attempt to establish a tradition upon which it could build.  In addition to his appreciation for Luis Senarens (**An American Jules Verne**) and Clement Fezandié (**Predicting Future Inventions**), Gernsback reprinted stories by Richard Adams Locke and Fitz James O'Brien.  Frequently mentioned nineteenth century authors mentioned in the pages of *Amazing* included H. Rider Haggard, Edward Bellamy, Garrett P. Serviss, M.P. Shiel, and Arthur Conan Doyle.  Contrary to later histories of proto-SF that emphasized texts commenting on the social or political context from which they emerged, Gernsback's nineteenth-century canon revolved around prognostication.  Westfahl: 

> In associating writers whose careers began in the 19th century with SF, Gernsback, unlike later historians, did not attribute their work to larger events in that era; they were rather persons ahead of their time, 'prophets' who anticipated both the value of scientific progress and the value of literature about scientific progress.  All on his own, Poe 'conceive[d] the idea of a scientific story.'  Thus, according to Gernsback, 19th-century SF was simply the product of isolated individual geniuses.^[@westfahl_jules_1992, p. 242-3, citing **The Lure of Scientifiction.**]

Using this definition of scientifiction as a "prophetic vision" of future machines and inventions "that were only to materialize centuries later," Gernsback argues that scientifiction can be traced all the way back to Leonardo Da Vinci and Francis Bacon (**The Lure of Scientifiction**).  Contrary to claims that the genre definitively began in 1926 with the introduction of *Amazing Stories,* these pieces make it clear that a very sophisticated understanding of the genre's roots as both deep and broad was already in place by the 1910s.  For instance, in a 1915 satirical patent application for a wearable apparatus for bookworms who would read both day and night, the illustration depicts an insatiable reader holding a copy of *Deadwood Dick,* suggesting that Gernsback and his colleagues were aware of an even broader tradition upon which they built (**Phoney Patent Offizz: Bookworm’s Nurse**).  *Deadwood Dick* was a series of dime novel westerns written by Edward L. Wheeler from 1877-1885, and under ghostwriters from 1886-1897.^[Wheeler "wore a Stetson hat, and is said to have greeted even strangers as 'pard.'"  @johannsen_house_1950, available online at Northern Illinois University Libraries's Beadle and Adams Dime Novel Digitization Project, <http://www.ulib.niu.edu/badndp/>.]  Dime novels serve as an important precursor to magazine era science fiction both materially---printed on very cheap paper and "sent to the army in the field by cords, like unsaved firewood" during the American Civil War---and thematically---featuring stories of marvels, lost races, and inventions like Edward S. Ellis's *Steam Man of the Prairies.*^[See @jencks_dime_1904; @bleiler_newark_1989.]  And though dime novels and the popular pulp magazines that followed were the product of "a revolution in industrial mass production that capitalized on North America’s vastly increased immigrant population, its decline in illiteracy rates, its rural postal delivery, and its increased urbanization,” the thinly drawn "enemies" were almost always signaled through ethnic markers.^[@ross_strange_1991, p. 106]  Everett F. Bleiler, in his entry on the dime novel in the *Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,* writes:

    

> Stress was on iron technology, with little or no science; narratives contained random, thrilling incidents, often presented in a disjointed and puerile way. Typical social patterns were: a conscious attempt to capitalize on age conflict, with boy inventors outdoing their elders (Edisonade); aggressive, exploitative capitalism, particularly at the expense of "primitive" peoples; the frontier mentality, with slaughter of "primitives" (in the first Frank Reade, Jr. story Frank kills about 250 Native Americans, to say nothing of destroying an inhabited village); strong elements of sadism; ethnic rancor focused on Native Americans, blacks, Irish and, later, Mexicans and Jews.^[@bleiler_dime-novel_2014.]

![](images/deadwood_dick_cover.jpg)

Take, for instance, the example of Gernsback's favorite nineteenth-century writer, Luis Senarens (1863-1939) who would go on writing into the twentieth.  The nineteenth-century writers championed by Gernsback were often known only by a *nom de plume,* which means that writers and readers alike could do interesting things with identity.  Luis Senarens (1863-1939), a Brooklyn-based Cuban American, was one of the few dime novel authors to be known by his given name in addition to the pseudonym he published under: "Noname."  Considering Samuel R. Delany's comments on what we lose along with authorial identities in the history of science fiction, Senarens's background is especially interesting:

> I believe I first heard Harlan Ellison make the point that we know of dozens upon dozens of early pulp writers only as names: They conducted their careers entirely by mail---in a field and during an era when pen names were the rule rather than the exception.  Among the 'Remington C. Scotts' and the 'Frank P. Joneses' who litter the contents pages of the early pulps, we simply have no way of knowing if one, three, or seven of them---or even many more---were blacks, Hispanics, women, Native Americans, Asians, or whatever.  Writing is like that.^[@delany_racism_2000.]

It would be nice if Senarens could prove the exception to this rule.  Much like Lisa Yaszek's work on the countless female authors (many publishing under male pen names) for whom writing science fiction in postwar suburban America was "virtually the only vehicle of political dissent," one wishes that Senarens as a Cuban author could shed light on marginalized communities that participated (as editors, readers, storytellers) in the otherwise suffocatingly white male world of dime novel, and later pulp fiction.^[@yaszek_galactic_2008, p. 3, quoting Judith Merril.]  Unfortunately, Senarens's work is in fact a distillation of the absolute worst tendencies of the dime novels' virulent racism and gleeful violence.  E.F. Bleiler's catalogue barely scratches the surface: "sadism, a rancorous disparaging of all races with the exception of WASPS, factual ignorance, coarse imperialist clichés about Manifest Destiny and the right of the White Man to rule the world."^[@bleiler_senarens_2014].

Four decades later, what had scientifiction learned from the earlier example of dime novels?  John Rieder has persuasively argued in *Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction* that interplanetary invasion narratives popular in the 1920s and 30s invoked the specters of colonial encounters between different cultures at the time.  In a mirror image of colonialism on Earth, stories confront white male heroes with civilizations and individuals far more advanced than anything they have seen before.  Within these stories

> lurks the possibility of finding oneself reduced by someone else’s progress to the helplessness of those who are unable to inhabit the present fully, and whose continued existence on any terms other than those of the conquerors has been rendered an archaism and anomaly.  Colonial invasion is the dark counter-image of technological revolution.  In relation to technology, as in other contexts, the history, ideology, and discourses of colonialism dovetail with the crucial, double perspective that runs throughout the genre:  on one hand, the wondrous exploration of the new and the marvelous encounter with the strange, but on the other, the post-apocalyptic vision of a world gone disastrously wrong.^[@rieder_colonialism_2008, p. 32-3.]

For Andrew Ross, the language of technical wizardry "functioned as a mark of the heroes’ superiority in coping with conditions in exotic localities like Mars or Venus, whose climates were simply displaced from the popular action-adventure regions of the arid West and tropical Africa respectively.”^[@ross_strange_1991, p. 111.]  The futures imagined in the pages of *Amazing Stories* were, perhaps unsurprisingly, overwhelmingly white.  The participation of women in these futures was circumscribed in very specific ways as well.  At one point, Gernsback defended the title *Amazing Stories* over the originally-proposed *Scientifiction* that was favored by many readers, because such the foregrounding of science might frighten off female readers.  The title is “the best one to influence the masses, because anything that smacks of science seems to be too ‘deep’ for the average type of reader. . . . we are certain that if the name of the magazine had been *Scientifiction,* [women] would not have been attracted to it at a newsstand." (**Editorially Speaking**).

A similar debate over the social identity of scientifiction broke out among readers when *Science Wonder Stories* simplified its name to *Wonder Stories* in June 1930.  Just as Gernsback does above, the conversation insidiously conflated genre and gender.  Describing the change in title, John Cheng writes that

> readers' responses were swift, heated, and divided.  Those readers interested in science fiction's science were appalled.  'Your aim, I take it, is to make the title more "catchy,"' wrote Lloyd E. Foltz of Indianapolis, Indiana, 'to that class of magazine addicts who are already reading, "Sappy Stories," "Slushy Romances," and so on, ad nauseam.'  He argued that the changes betrayed science fiction's premise.  'I believe this is a mistake,' he said.  'It will attract a type of reader to whom S. A. means sex appeal and not scientific adventure.'  Other readers disagreed.  'Now for the burden that some of the readers seem to carry---romance,' wrote Darrel Richards, 8620 Hamilton Avenue, Detroit Michigan.  'Why shouldn't "females" … be included in the science fiction stories?' he asked.  'Remember, "Love makes the world go around."'^[@cheng_astounding_2012, 116.]

Justine Larbalestier points out that in many conversations on genre among readers, "the terms 'love interest,' 'romance,' 'sex,' and 'women' are used interchangeably.  They become one and the same.  On the whole this equivalence between 'women' and 'love interest' disqualifies women from the field of science fiction, since love belongs to the field of romance."^[larbalestier_battle_2002, p. 10.]  An argument for minimizing the presence of romance elements in scientifiction thus becomes---in some cases explicitly---about marginalizing women.[^s28b]  One reader, Mary Byers of Springfield, OH, in a response to a young Isaac Asimov who wrote: "When we want science-fiction, we don't want swooning dames, and that goes double. . . . Come on, men, make yourself heard in favor of less love mixed with our science!", writes:  "To his plea for less hooey I give my whole-hearted support, but less hooey does not mean less women; it means a difference in the way they are introduced into the story and the part they play."^[@byers_other_1938.]  Larbalestier argues that Byers's retort echoes later feminist science fiction critics like Joanna Russ.  Interesting for our purposes is Larbalestier's argument that, given the communal, conversational nature of scientifiction, the very structure of the genre actually ended up giving women a way into an arena they were formerly excluded from.  The rules of that supposedly masculine genre allowed it to call into question the hard and fixed gender norms enforced by many readers.

[^s28b]: For an account of a late 1930s debate among readers of *Astounding Science Fiction* that typifies this equivalency between genre and gender, (including an eighteen-year-old Isaac Asmiov who writes, "When we want science-fiction, we don't want swooning dames, and that goes double. … Come on, men, make yourself heard in favor of less love mixed with our science!"), see @larbalestier_battle_2002, 117-135.  Larbalestier provides readings of women SF writers as well, including Claire Winger Harris, the first regular female writer in the SF magazines, and Leslie F. Stone, whose story "The Conquest of Gola" in *Wonder Stories* April 1931 issue thematized the "battle of the sexes."

"Science," wrote Gernsback in the inaugural issue of *Amazing Stories*,

> through its various branches of mechanics, astronomy, etc., enters so intimately into all our lives today, and we are so much immersed in this science, that we have become rather prone to take new inventions and discoveries for granted. Our entire mode of living has been changed with the present progress, and it is little wonder, therefore, that many fantastic situations [...] are brought about today. It is in these situations that the new romancers find their great inspiration. (**A New Sort of Magazine**)

Gernsback envisioned scientifiction as a form of popular education in which the reader might not even be aware that she was learning about the science that went into the construction of her everyday experience.  Because "The average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of scientific facts . . . we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study" (**The New Science and Invention**).  What Gernsback couldn't have anticipated was the way in which the genre itself would end up learning from the diverse makeup of its community.  Today, this is a powerful reminder during a moment in which the Hugo Awards have become the occasion for a celebration of voices that have gone unrecognized in science fiction for far too long.[^sdpp]  From its humble beginnings, scientifiction would actually become expansive enough to address "all our lives" in a way that reminds us that there's an entire universe of radically different vistas to experience right here at home.
