[Scientifiction]

(Begin with Mars -- each section begins with how the seemingly strange, to us, was totally commonplace in the weird early 20th century -- EMBRACE THE WEIRD).

To move from footnotes:

	- Editorially Speaking (on female readers/authors)

	- An American Jules Verne (on nonwhite authors)

	- On "The Moon Hoax," an editorial introduction, my line: the mark of a truly modern work of scientifiction was the speed with which the truth of the story could be proven or disproven by the community.  Fn. in "Editorially Speaking."

In 1909, the canal controversy was in full swing, and the idea that there was an ancient race of Martians living on the red planet was more than just fanciful escapism.  It was part of a broader public discourse.  From 19… to 19…, the *New York Times* ran front page stories on the latest observations of the planet's surface, or the latest attempts to decode "messages" skimmed from the airwaves.

Gernsback was already familiar with Lowell’s work, having devoured his book *Mars* (1895) in a single day as a young boy in Luxembourg.  It was the writings of Lowell that first led Gernsback to read the fiction of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.^[@siegel_hugo_1988, p. 16]

So in 1909, when Gernsback published **"Signaling to Mars,"** his was one of the more hard nosed proposals to communicate with the red planet.  The article is all about the possibility of sending a wireless message through space, and a concrete proposal for how to turn what may seem like a fanciful idea (the fantasy of extraterrestrial communication is, here at least, held at bay) into a technical reality.  For the most part, this would be the blueprint, the … core at the heart of what would become scientifiction over the next two decades.  Much like *narrative* scientifiction, early future-directed articles consist simply of a speculative technology and its engineering specifications.  The horizon of these proposals can be a few years, as it is for the feasibility of a workable prototype for television, decades, as it is in the Mars proposal, or several centuries, as it is in **"Our Cover,"** (1913) with its description of a cityscape that utilizes vertical space not through skyscrapers but floating buildings and infrastructure.  It's for this reason that Gernsback referred to Clement Fezandié as a "titan of science fiction"^[@gernsback_guest_1961].  These stories do exactly what G's earlier, ostensibly non-fiction editorials about the future do---posit a technology a technology, describe in minute detail how it works, and briefly explore why that technology will be economically and sometimes socially important.

This was certainly not the first speculation that using wireless we would be able to communicate with Mars.  “If any of the planets be populated with beings like ourselves, then if they could oscillate immense stores of electrical energy to and fro in telegraphic order, it would be possible for us to hold ocmmune by telephone with the people of Mars.”  William Preece, entineer-in-chief of the British Post Office and radio experimenter (qtd in Susan Douglas, “Amateur Operators and American Broadcasting”).  Reveiew of Reviews 18, December 1898.  p. 715.  and Thomas Waller, “Can We Radio a Message to Mars?”  Illustrated World 33, April 1920, p. 242 

Today, the phrase "science fiction" conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, starships, and sonic screwdrivers. But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before a century's accretion of images, narratives, and clichés, that which was not yet called science fiction consisted of a great number of concrete practices all geared toward a reckoning with the technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life. "Science," wrote Gernsback in the inaugural issue of *Amazing Stories*,

> through its various branches of mechanics, astronomy, etc., enters so intimately into all our lives today, and we are so much immersed in this science, that we have become rather prone to take new inventions and discoveries for granted. Our entire mode of living has been changed with the present progress, and it is little wonder, therefore, that many fantastic situations [...] are brought about today. It is in these situations that the new romancers find their great inspiration. (**"A New Sort of Magazine"** (1926))

* * * * * * * * * * * * 

Hugo Gernsback has been given very little attention in science fiction studies, with the field's leading critics often assuming that *Amazing Stories* was little more than a marketing gimmick for Gernsback's technical ventures.  The fiction published in the pages of his magazines is often seen to have very little aesthetic or literary value.  So when Gernsback is given credit in the foundation of modern American SF, it is as a kind of marketer of a new brand name, rather than a writer or editor.  As Alexi and Cory Panshin write, "In the pages of *Amazing*, SF literature at last became identified by a single name: 'scientifiction.' It was provided with a history. It was defined and demonstrated. It was consolidated and unified. In *Amazing*, SF became conscious of itself."^[@panshin_world_1989, 170.]  According to John Clute and Peter Nicholls, Gernsback "gave the genre a local habitation and a name," and for James Gunn, he "provided a focus for enthusiasm, for publication, for development," and bestowed science fiction with its "characteristic content, a characteristic form, and characteristic purposes."^[@clute_encyclopedia_1995, 491. @gunn_alternate_1975, 128.] 

These critical histories (each of which are written by SF novelists in their own right) proceed as if propelled by their own fantastic, alternate history: what if science fiction left us with texts as highly valued as the works of modernism from the very beginning? No doubt the field of science fiction studies has done a great deal of work in order to elevate certain works of the genre (mainly from the 1960s and 70s New Wave) to a kind of academic respectability. But these assumptions about the genre's magazine era beginnings have never been questioned, nor have any of Gernsback's publications save for *Amazing Stories* been submitted to any kind of rigorous analysis. The editorial function many SF histories begrudgingly ascribe to Gernsback overlooks the much more interesting heritage of magazine SF within a wider tradition of thinking about new media.

Points

--------

The strange idea embedded in the Münchausen story included here that "there is no fiction":

> If, as often---no, always---has been proved that the most violent fiction at some time or other invariably comes true, then by all proceeds of modern logic, there cannot be such thing as fiction. It simply does not exist. This brings us face to face with the startling result that if fiction always comes true some time or other, why then, bless their dear souls, all fiction writers must be prophets!!

Whose progress? Role of women, and masculinity seen as something genre specific to SF.

    192609_editorially_speaking -- though SF seen by readers as masculine and romance feminine, it was the rules of the former that allowed gender roles to be questioned in these magazines.  Also, "modern" scientifiction is distinguished from older by the speed with which a fantastic idea could be proven or disproven, through communications media.  Thus the rules of that supposedly masculine genre allowed it to call into question the hard and fixed gender norms enforced by many readers.

Writing SF stories as craft, and anonymous craftspeople.

"We admit that all of this sounds extremely fantastic, but the truths of tomorrow will surpass the wildest fiction." (192202_10k_years)

Being taught without knowing it.  Wonder vs. technical knowledge.

Proper proportion of science to fiction, see fn to "Fiction Versus Facts" and consider removing the piece.  Just use quote from Wertenbaker.  What’s interesting is that the genre partly begins around a conversation on a problem to be solved: how to marry quality with technical complexity, how precisely science and fiction fit together in the best ratio?  See @westfahl_mightiest_2015, 25, on early complains about story quality and true fans’ dislike of space opera.

History/tradition of scientifiction

    As early as 1915, Gernsback cites nineteenth century dime novels like *Deadwood Dick* and authors like Luis Senarens ("The American Jules Verne"), revealing an awareness of the genealogy of science fiction over a decade before the launch of *Amazing Stories* in 1926, when most SF critics locate the birth of the genre.  These essays make clear that a very sophisticated understanding of the genre's roots was already in place by the 1910s, and that science fiction as we understand it today was a rich and variegated series of activities, rather than merely a literary form.

    191511_bookworm_patent -- an understanding of the 19th century precursors, the tradition on which his magazines built.  Also, an understanding that his readers were ravenous.

    192604_a_new_sort -- 200 years ago, these kind of stories were impossible without "science," which now enters so intimately into our daily lives.  So we take this science for granted, but the role of scientifiction is to teach us without being aware of being taught.

    192606_lure_of_scientifiction -- Scientifiction goes back to Da Vinci, Bacon, etc.  Even longer roots than the 19C.  Also, there's a community of "fans" whose imaginations are fired by these modern day SF authors.  Fans beginning to be a huge force

The defense of "fiction," "imagination," and "fantasy," as opposed to "facts."  See Donna Haraway in the opening to *Primitive Acts.*  “Facts are opposed to opinion, to prejudice, but not to fiction.  Both ficiton an fact are rooted in an epistemology that appeals to experience.”  Fiction is “an active form, referring to a present act of fashioning” and fact “is a descendant of a past participle, a word form which masks the generative deed or performance.  A fact seems done, unchangeable, fit only to be recorded” while “ficiton seems always inventive, open to other possibilities, other fashionings of life.” (quoted in Cheng, p. 103)

    191305_our_cover -- Defending the presence of the future and the "fantastic" in this technology magazine, which would have been foreign to other publications of the time (QST? Wireless World? Directly compare them!)  The point of these future scenes/portraits is to inspire the electrical experimenter.

    191604_imagination_versus_facts -- Yes, these magazines emphasize imaginary things, the imagination, but *progress* makes anything possible with time.  With time, the imagination becomes fact.  And it is the job of *Electrical Experimenter* to fire the imagination.

    192010_american_verne -- w/ Lu Senarens, imagination is quite literally invention

    193212_reasonableness_in -- a strong rejoinder to authors (and Campbell) that SF must be plausible!

    193009_science_faction -- There is a spectrum of the fantastic:  "probable, possible, and near-impossible."  But the best SF is "prophetic."  This SF, once read in the future, mutates with time, it becomes "science faction."  It loses its imaginative charge and just becomes a list of facts.  This is HG's take on paleofuturism.  **Relate this to "The Gernsback Continuum" idea of old futures.**  Re-read this article -- it shows there's not just a temporal divide between old and new futures, but a matter of taste.  Maybe *Scientific Detective Stories* are faction because they're set in the present with all real technologies?

    192202_10k_years -- an article on the horizon of predictability for the "up-to-date scientist," then jumps 10,000 years to show just how good of a prophet HG is, perhaps.  Future truths will surpass today's wildest "fiction" or fantasies.

What is invention?

    192308_predicting_inventions -- Invention considered as a form of prophecy:  Working over the abstract idea of something that doesn't exist (what Chu calls the "cognitively estranging referent") using the raw material of hope and the imagination.  This leads to the strange idea that the inventor of the automobile wasn't Ford or ……… but nineteenth century approximators who constructed steam-powered prototypes of what they would later "know" to be the automobile:  "inventors over 150 years back knew the automobile."  So too is Verne seen as quite literally inventing the submarine, Leonardo da Vinci the steam engine and breech-loading gun, and Roger Bacon the telescope and gun powder (see "Lure of Scientifiction").  This is the essay where the idea of "exploiting the future" comes into play

	Footnoted in this piece is "The Mentality of Inventors," an article that isn't included, which seems to contradict his thoughts in "Born and the Mechanical."  In the former, an inventor is someone who takes an existing idea and clarifies or perfects it.  In the latter, an inventor's idea emerges whole cloth from his mind.  Also, the following essay, "Are We Intelligent," cites the information overload for everyday people w/ modern technology, and that S&I is designed to match the speed with which people disseminate information now.  A very familiar sounding approach now, with digestible news stories and the time to read listed in the header, etc.

    192610_imagination_and_reality -- Gernsback's emphasis on the signature of scientifiction shifts in this editorial (192610_imagination_and_reality) away from objectively verifiable probability (as in **"Fiction Versus Facts"**) and toward an inspiration to future invention, no matter how seemingly fantastic. Given the fact that the wonders we've seen in the past years, the argument goes, the prophecies of the past that have seemingly been fulfilled, one would be a fool to dismiss anything as impossible.  He does, however, in this editorial, separate the author (stimulus) from the inventor (realization).  So, again, a slightly different version here.  How does it square with the idea above that invention works through a series of mistakes (a mousetrap is really a good burglar alarm?)

    But what is the "truth" of "The Moon Hoax", included in the canon? This is verifiably false yet counted as charming and imaginative. Gernsback clarifies the difference a bit in "Science Fiction Versus Science Faction." An economy by which (prophetic) fiction is transformed into (scientific) fact.  The Moon Hoax isn't prophetic scientifiction, because it didn't become fact.  Only the best does.

    19302_how_to_write -- scientific apparatus and methods are like clouds: the background, the setting of fiction.  And successful scientifiction writing requires research.  Also, first article in which HG uses the phrase "science fiction" (at least in this collection).

## Scientifiction 

“In the early years of pulp science fiction magazines in the 1920s and 1930s there are not many letters that discuss what science fiction or scientifiction is.  Everyone knew what ‘it’ was — it had something to do with ‘science’ — but everyone seemed to have a different notion of what constituted ‘science,’ what does and does not belong to the universe of science fiction and who has the rights to make these decisions.  What science fiction is, the genre, is taken for granted in the letters, but the texts, the instances of this genre, are not so defined, so that attempts to limit the field become a series of test cases about which there is not always agreement.” @larbalestier_battle_2002, 33

See Larbalestier section, “the science in science fiction,” 31-38

“For interwar science fiction, ‘amazing,’ ‘astounding,’ and ‘wonder’ were more than magazine titles; they were also metaphors for a specific style to imagine science, clarion calls for its conversation.  … Gernsback developed a view of participatory science before he began his science fiction ventures…” @cheng_astounding_2012

See next 192310 “The New Science and Invention” on how he sees the magazine’s role in popular science

	"The reason is that the average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of text of scientific facts, which means concentration and study. With fiction, however, this does not hold true because fiction is an entertainment; it does not require study. On the other hand, *we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study.*"

"If we may voice our own opinion [after the beautiful sentiments of young Wertenbaker in his letter qtd in 192607 Fiction Versus Facts] we should say the ideal proportion of a scientifiction story should be seventy-five per cent literature interwoven with twenty-five per cent science."  Itself a scientific, rote formula for genre production.

> *Foundational writings on science fiction as a distinct genre, including literary historical essays on writers Gernsback understood to be predecessors: Wells, Verne, Poe, Luis Senarens, Clement Fezandié.*

Today, the phrase "science fiction" conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, starships, and sonic screwdrivers. But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before a century's accretion of images, narratives, and clichés, that which was not yet called science fiction consisted of a great number of concrete practices all geared toward a reckoning with the technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life. "Science," wrote Gernsback in the inaugural issue of *Amazing Stories*,

## Selected fiction

> *Four short stories and the original serialized version of the famous* Ralph 124C 41+, *all of which have been out of print since their original magazine publication.*

While editions of Gernsback's *Ralph 124C 41+* have been republished in 1950, 1958, and 2000, all of these use a revised version of the text Gernsback updated in 1929. The original, serial version from 1911 has not been seen since its original magazine print run. There are significant differences between these two versions of the novel that deserve to be looked at by a wider audience.

Other short stories by Gernsback that have not been reprinted include "New York A.D. 2660" (1911), "The Magnetic Storm" (1918), "The Electric Duel" (1927), and "The Killing Flash" (1929). As mentioned above, the speculative mode of these fictions is not out of step with the technical articles they were published alongside. Including them within the continuum of essays on broadcast regulation and tinkering allows them to be experienced in a context similar to their original intentions.

	As one reader put it:  “I have been more or less narrow-minded myself.  I could not see, for the life of me, why it was that the editor continued the story of the ‘Baron Münchausen’s Scientific Adventures,’ but after reading a few installments I began to look at improbabilities with the far distant view of probability.”  E.A. Norstadt, Electrical Experimenter, Sept. 1916: 331.

Emphasis on forum, but a debased one:  

	James Gunn, Alternate Worlds: The Illustrated History of SF:  “Gernsback provided a focus for enthusiasm, for publication, for development.  He may not have shaped modern science fiction… but he provided a place for science fiction to be shaped.  Looking back on the place, it may have been a ghetto, but it was a golden ghetto, a place of brotherhood and opportunity and wonder.  Before Gernsback there were science fiction stories.  After Gernsback, there was a science fiction genre.” (128) 

	Malcolm J. Edwards:  in ESF:  G “gave the genre a local habitation and a name,” and “bestowed upon his creation provincial dogmatism and an illiteracy that bedeviled US SF for years.”

	Aldiss (sets the disparaging tone for some years):  as Landon Brooks puts it, summarizing the current state of scholarship (or lack thereof) on Gernsback, influenced by Aldiss:  “Gernsback’s approach to science fiction was so crude and heavy-handed that it actually initiated most of the negative stereotypes that have been advanced to disparage science fiction” (54).

	Landon Brooks, leaving questions of quality aside, writes that Amazing Stories was “the first true science fiction magazine—the birthplace of genre science fiction,” and Gernsback was “science fiction’s first great editor and critic.”

For others, Amazing Stories was merely a commercial venture to save Gernsback’s failing magazine and broadcast “empire.”  Brian Stableford:  “Amazing Stories was purely a commercial venture, which [he] undertook because he thought his existing subscription lists might help establish a secure commercial base for such a magazine” (48).  Siphoning off the finances of Experimenter Publishing Company in order to save his broadcast station WRNY?  The genre would have to wait for later editors such as John W. Campbell and Donald Wollheim to become “a genre that had authentic potential as a medium of scientific speculation, and as a means of investigating the sweeping social changes which scientific and technological progress would inevitably participate.”  (49-50 sic??)

Magazine context:

	Landon Brooks, Science Fiction After 1900.  “Amazing appeared in the context of several other pulp magazines devoted to a single kind of fiction.  Following the general lead of Frank Munsey, who invented the pulp magazine all-fiction format in Argosy (1896), and who had tried specializing in one kind of story in 1906 with Railroad Man’s Magazine, Street & Smith publishers brought out Detective Story Monthly in 1915, Western Story in 1919, Love STories in 1921, and Weird Tales in 1923.  Accordingly, genre SF arose in the much larger pulp market that had supplanted dime novels and boys’ papers and that would continue to dominate popular publishing into the 1950s.” (51)

Pulp publishing begins with Frank Munsey’s Argosy magazine in 1895.  Pulp publishing “was a revolution in industrial mass production that capitalized on North America’s vastly increased immigrant population, its decline in illiteracy rates, its rural postal delivery, and its increased urbanization.” (Ross 106)  Munsey was a former telegraph operator. @readers

G very much part of the now militated against discourse of SF as prediction, anticipation, being “ahead of one’s time.”  But there's something interesting about this cryptic, proto SF

“Critics of Gernsbackianism have charged that Gernsback’s devotion to the pragmatic, hardware-oriented tradition of invention was a formula for technological fiction only and had little to do with a properly scientific fiction that fully questioned the nature of the objective world.  …  At the core of the Gernsback formula, however, was a populist principle that science could be explained and understood by everyone, and that its name would not be associated with exclusive rhetorical idioms or with obfuscatory accounts of the object world by overaccredited experts.  For Gernsback, scientific language was a universal language of progress that ought to be accessible even to those without a college degree.  Indeed, the straightforward prose of early SF clearly contrasts with the rich American argot of local dialects found in the Western and hard-boiled genres.  Its undeveloped style is equally distinct from the luxurious hand of the likes of H.P. Lovecraft, whose overwritten fantasies crammed the pages of Weird Tales. (Ross 111)

Delany quote on HG SF and the poetry of things, of objects.

Race and martians:  Ferdinand the Martian is “black, he was black all over.”  Ask about his face, which store proprietor says was also black, before he says Martian was “covered wit ha black cloth.”  The Martians have technologies far beyond the ken of even Ralph.  The only people who could outsmart him, he concludes, are the Martians.  165

Ross, “universal” language of science for white men and boys only.  “In particular, this language functioned as a mark of the heroes’ superiority in coping with conditions in exotic localities like Mars or Venus, whose climates were simply displaced from the popular action-adventure regions of the arid West and tropical Africa respectively.”

Gernsback's important SF author finds, according to Moskowitz:

David H. Keller, M.D., "the pioneer in what later was to become popular as 'psychological' science fiction stories; Edward E. Smith, the creator of the super-sceince tale; John W. Campbell, Jr.; Philip FRancis Nowlan, whose stories of Anthony (Buck) Rogers ran in *Amazing Stories* some time before they appeared as a comic strip; Stanton A. Coblentz, poet and, in his fiction, magazine science fiction's best satirist in the tradition of Jonathan Swift; A. Hyatt Verrill, outstanding archaeologist; Fletcher Pratt, later celebrated naval writer; Harl Vincent, Bob Olsen, Miles J. Breuer, M.D., and Jack Williamson." @moskowitz_explorers_1963, 237

@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 320, "scientifiction" seems like it was very much a marketing idea, with other magazines responding in editorials that their stories *weren't* pseudo-scientific.  Like Argosy and Weird Tales.

On Ralph:  according to @henzig_hugo_2010, p. 93, HG was largely inspired by Mark Wicks' 1911 book *To Mars via the Moon: An Astronomical Story.*  It was reviewed anonymously, probably by HG in the September 1911 issue of ME, and from the November 1911 issue of ME on, "the layout and the content of Gernsback's story consequently changed.  Suddenly, illustrations appear in the text (similar to the style Wicks used in his book) and the narrative evolves to an interplanetary space opera.  As Gary Westfahl comments, Wicks himself had a very important impact on the way Gernsback would approach his conception of Science Fiction in the coming years.  Up to that point, he concentrated on being a prophet or visionary, from the end of 1911 he was convinced that he had to add a stronger educational aspect and some action to his writings."  Find Westfahl's comments on Wicks either in HG and the Century of OR Mechanics of Wonder.

Also, the instrumental nature of the narrative, not just in its content but its form.  Serially, the story goes, written month by month, to fill space in issues of ME as needed.  Gernsback was learning as we went as he went along not only how to write fiction but specifically how *scientifiction* narrative should work.

“His publishing endeavors after that date [when he lost control of Wonder Stories in 1936] had far less influence on the field, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s he delegated the editorial work on these magazines to T. O’Conor Sloane, C.A. Brandt, and Wilbur C. Whitehead (Clute and Nicholls 1993: 490-91; Tymn and Ashley 1985: 14-57).  This means that Gernsback did not necessarily write all or even the majority of the editorial comments during the periods in which he was the publisher and editor of such magazines as Amazing Stories and Wonder Stories.  However, such is the mythic force of Gernsback, the founding father, that in the majority of the work I have read on this period he is spoken of as though he wrote every word of editorial comment in the magazines he published.  ‘Gernsback’ has come to operate as synonymous with the magazines he founded, whether he was actively contributing to them or not.  I will continue this practice, allowing ‘Gernsback’ to stand for the house editorial voice.”  An important point to emphasize here, that Gernsback is more or less the magazines.  A collection of “his” writings is a collection of the voice that stood in for the conversation of this growing community, this growing discourse on media, technology, and the future.
