[[This section could possibly be removed -- do I really have to tell a little history of radio and television in the US?  Yes, partially -- whether or not amateurs made important contributions to the development of these new media.  But, this can be chopped up and dispersed into other sections.]]

amateur avant garde

--------------------------

What role did this community play?

A detente throughout the 1910s after the Radio Act is passed, wherein amateurs could still be seen as the avant garde.

Though HG and collaborators feel left out of the broadcast boom, Radio News is still a beacon for tinkerers around the world, who feel that their sets are far superior to the "average" sets sold by companies, in department stores, etc., and that they serve as the vanguard of advancing the "science."

The amateur avant garde:  

> The set builder naturally is well able to compete with the manufacturer, for two reasons. First, his time costs him little, and in price, therefore, he can compete easily with the factory-made set. Secondly, he has the jump on the manufactured set for the simple reason that, as like as not, his circuit is the latest out, and, therefore, will have improvements that the manufactured set can not boast for some months to come.  (**Radio Enters a New Phase**)

But later, when the technology and the regulation of radio becomes too complicated for amateurs to follow, when WRNY is forced to shut down by the FCC because it's too small, we see a different track being taken, an archaeology of forgotten developments that are simpler, and can still prove useful.

These contradictions [extolling the virtues of the amateur and the tinkerer while being bankrolled by RCA and AT&T(?) advertising revenue] abounded in the pages of Gernsback’s publications.  

1925 Sept -- "General Harbord Explains the Patent Situation" 252+ president of RCA.  192509

The May 1920 issue (v8n1) described C.D. Wagoner, “The New Radio Corporation,” on the formation of RCA, and two years later, their ads were being run in HG publications:  “[RCA ad]” p. 877.  Science and Invention Jan 1922, v9n9  RCA ads in a Gernsback mag as early as Jan 1922.  “Listening to Broadcasted News and Music from the Radio Telephone.”  In bed with their money early on.  

From **Radio Enters Into a New Phase,** HG defends patents as a monopoly:  RCA holds a patent on virtually every important radio related invention.  Gernsback argues that every patent is a monopoly.  Any small set manufacturer has to pay expensive royalties, phasing out all but the largest firms.  G is strangely optimistic about this possibility:  “What has been predicted for a number of years has thus come to pass.  The radio set business will be in the hands of a few strong corporations, which will control the legitimate set business in the United States on a highly competitive basis.  All other reports to the contrary, this certainly is not a general monopoly of the set business; and we believe that, in time to come, it will work out to the advantage of the public.”  But set manufacturers are slower to change than the experimenter.

As Tim Wu argues, Radio News even served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country’s history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and “what one might expect to hear on them—a forerunner of the once hugely profitable TV Guide” (39)  What these lists reveal is that much of the chatter on the air as early as 1922 came from corporate sources:  “many early stations were run by radio manufacturers such as Westinghouse, the pioneer of the ready-to-plug-in model [a claim Gernsback would certainly dispute], and RCA, both of which had an obvious interest in promoting the medium.  Still many stations were run by amateurs, ‘radio clubs,’ universities, churches, hotels, poultry farms, newspapers, the U.S. Army and Navy” (39).

The example of the lists (apparently published many times in Radio News?) cited by Wu is Armstrong Perry, “What Anyone Can Hear: Complete List of Broadcasting Stations in U.S.”  March 1922, 814.

“[RCA ad]” p. 877.  Science and Invention Jan 1922, v9n9  RCA ads in a Gernsback mag as early as Jan 1922.  “Listening to Broadcasted News and Music from the Radio Telephone.”  In bed with their money early on.

G., “The Garrett Inventor” v15n11, 192803 — “It was pointed out, in all sincerity, that no great inventions could possibly come from the small inventor in the future.” …  “The story sounded plausible enough, because in all of the laboratories of our large industrial companies, research scientists are busy, day and night, in inventing and perfecting new devices.”  Gives examples of how this is not the case. 

Andrew Ross:  “Industrial corporations either controlled or purchased most invention patents, hoarding them in order to suppress competition, while independent inventors lacked the big capital that was increasingly required for research and development of their alternative technologies.  As a result, the explosive age of industrial invention lay in the past, viewed as much too volatile in its effects for the scientifically regulated process of production favored by monopoly capitalism.  The new emphasis on control, precision, uniformity, predictability, and standardization meant the extinction of the entrepreneur-inventor, whose heyday had included the likes of George Westinghouse, Francis Richards, Edward Weston, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Lee De Forest, Elihu Thomson, Charles Brush, Charles Hall, Edward Dean Acheson, and Elmer Sperry.  While scientists became increasingly ‘proletarianized,’ the new Fordist compromise meant that monopoly cartels, often in agreement with labor unions, would seek new uses for old technology rather than risking the potential instability offered by new labor-saving, and ecologically sound, technologies.” (124)

television and community experimentation

-------------------------------------------------------

definitely use, then delete or rephrase from 193107 Television Technique:

[^rqrn]: Gernsback's first editorial for this magazine emphasized a slightly different point: that the large corporations---who by necessity had to be depended on to produce these incredibly complex and expensive technologies---were actually stifling competition by "jealously guarding whatever improvements are made, because these large firms naturally wish to come out with a complete set that can be sold ready-made to the public."  Continuing his argument that communities of amateur tinkerers, openly sharing their results, were a necessary element in the development of new media, Gernsback continues:

> Everyone knows that, the more people who are working on an art, the more rapid the progress will be in the end.  Many improvements in radio have been due to experimenters who started in a small way and, later on, became outstanding figures in radio. … The more experimenters and the more television fans who become interested in the art, the quicker it will advance and the sooner it will be put on the stable basis which it deserves.

He saw *Television News* as providing an entry point for this community of amateur television experimenters that had yet to come into being:  "To this purpose I am dedicating this new publication, and the future will demonstrate the correctness of the assumption."^[@gernsback_television_1931.]

Mixing up sensory inputs: television signals become tacticle and auditory sensation.  Media are synonymous with the mechanical transportation and simulation of sensory inputs.

“An interesting phenomenon in connection with television itself is that, if the output currents of the light-sensitive cell are listened to in a telephone receiver, they can be heard as sounds, and every object or scene has its own peculiar characteristic sound.  For example, the fingers of a hand held in front of the transmitter will give rise to a sound similar to the grating of a very coarse file, while the human face will cause a high-pitched whistle which will vary in pitch as the head is turned or even when the features are moved.  For experimental purposes Mr. Baird had some phonograph records made of the sounds made by different persons’ faces, and by listening carefully to the reproductions of these records it is possible to distinguish between one face and another by the sounds they make!  With practice, faces may even be recognized by the sounds produced.”^[@dinsdale_television_1927]

lifting from Edison patent language on cinema/phonograph:  “To the layman who does not as yet know what television is, I may say that the term describes an electrical process, whereby it is possible to see at a distance and to view distant events as they are taking place.  In this way television does for the eye what the telephone does for the ear.  Your friend, using the telephone, talks to you from his office, while you are sitting in yours; while the television process is comparable in that you will see your friend as he is talking to you, and, vice versa, he will see you.”^[@gernsback_television_1927]
