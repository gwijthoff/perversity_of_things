In this way, scientifiction wasn't a literary development but a social movement, an extension of the project that began with the technical magazines.

[[NOT QUITE:  still a kind of colonialist, slumming argument.  Need to land on an ethical encounter with the other, that doesn't… "other" the other.]]

One might consider "fact" to be a matter of the past tense and "fiction" as having a certain future-directedness.  Donna Harraway outlines the distinction:

> Fiction's kinship to facts is close, but they are not identical twins.  Facts are opposed to opinion, to prejudice, but not to fiction.  Both fiction and fact are rooted in an epistemology that appeals to experience.  However, there is an important difference; the word *fiction* is an active form, referring to a present act of fashioning, while *fact* is a descendant of a past participle, a word form which masks the generative deed or performance.  A fact seems done, unchangeable, fit only to be recorded; fiction seems always inventive, open to other possibilities, other fashionings of life.  But in this opening lies the threat of merely feigning, of not telling the true form of things.^[@haraway_primate_1990, p. 4.]

@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 320, "scientifiction" seems like it was very much a marketing idea, with other magazines responding in editorials that their stories *weren't* pseudo-scientific.  Like Argosy and Weird Tales.

and later, in *Sexology* (1933), a relatively progressive treatment of masturbation, homosexuality, and premarital sex into the 1950s and 60s, although articles on "breastfeeding fathers, women with extra breasts, Hitler's sex life, [and] rubber fetishism" were more common.^[Though it's outside the scope of this volume, for a selection of articles from this magazine see @yoe_best_2008.]

(Consider the heritage of this approach to media and speculative thought.  In many ways, media theory has always involved a kind of science fictional spirit, a willingness to think the present state of technosocial realities differently.  The historical collection of essays from the 1980s and 90s *Ars Electronica: Facing the Future* ed. Druckrey is exemplary in this repsect.

Jenkins:  "And, increasingly, media theorists—raised in a culture where science fiction has been a pervasive influence—are drawing on its metaphors as they speculate about virtual worlds, cyborg feminism, post-humanism, and afro-futurism, among a range of other topics."

If not in a positivist, technoutopian vein, then at least with an openness to the future.)

This isn't a simple fetishism for technology, but a genuine interest in *how* things worked and in spreading that knowledge to the public.  He believed that understanding technology meant making it from scratch, or at least taking it apart to understand how it worked.  So yes, sometimes socially blind, but his maker's ethos constituted a social imperative in its own right.

Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.  Magic?

In part, this is a book about the origins of American science fiction.  It’s also a look at the emergence of new media around community practices rather than new technical standards or innovations.

Technical literacy was encouraged not only through blueprints and instruction manuals for the amateur tinkerer, but also through thought experiments and graphical projections of what these new media might look like.  This was Gernsback's forté: reading fantastic possibilities for the future of technologically advanced societies off the shape of the most mundane of material objects, techniques and processes.

In …, the addition and subtraction of each wire, condenser, or tuning hookup constituted a full-scale shift in the abilities and sensory affects of the apparatus being constructed as well as the narrative form through which it was described.  

In many ways, this poses a classic science fictional question: how can national borders remain in the face of a dawning global consciousness?  The answer, of course, is that these utopian dreams were themselves the product of an American public that emerged from the horrors of World War I seemingly unscathed.  What they didn't realize was that the network of large wireless relay towers whose signals were a popular draw for new and existing amateur listeners were themselves a product of the United States's nationalist ambitions in the wake of the Spanish-American War.  Wireless at that time was seen as an important tool in networking and securing the public.  (See the annotations in "Wired Radio Versus Space Radio" for more on the strategic control of submarine cables after the Spanish-American War.)

At work here is a certain form of magic, when we don’t know how something works but we can see that, plainly, it does (see Mauss).  Our suspicion is elicited, nonetheless.  …prototyping the future — understanding what the future will be like, setting up the conditions in which we can assess and critique its coming, with ready to hand, available material objects.  

"…we do not define magic in terms of the structure of its rites, but by the circumstances in which the rites occur, which in turn determine the place they occupy in the totality of social customs." (Mauss 30)

The traditional character of magic is "bound up with the arts and crafts.  The successive gestures of an artisan may be as uniformly regulated as those of a magician."  (24)

But in magic, "it is not really believed that the gestures themselves bring about the result.  The effect derives from something else, and usually this is not of the same order."  Technique, on the other hand, maintains a "homogeneity between cause and effect."  "Everyone knows that the results are achieved directly through the co-ordination of action, tool and physical agent." (25)

As a result, until 1938, when John Campbell took the editor’s chair at Astounding and transformed the class dynamics of the field, science fiction magazines are best understood in the way Michael Denning treats dime novels, as dialogic texts where mostly middle-class writers ventriloquized the working-class accents of their readers to advance their views of the world. This complex voicing, and the fact that both working-class and disaffected wage-earners wrote back to the magazines, make science fiction some of the best evidence we have of the ways a particularly beset urban group of would-be wage earners understood their prospects of attaining a middle-class life in the 1920s and 30s, and in particular how young middle-class women’s move out of the home and into self-supporting occupations affected these prospects.^[@drown_business_2006.]

“Csicsery-Ronay calls particular attention to those “fantasies of physical mastery and engineering know-how” that continue to drive so much science fiction as part and parcel of the way imperialism “facilitated the subjugation of less developed cultures, wove converging networks of technical administration, and established standards of ‘objective measurement’ that led inevitably to myths of racial and national supremacy.” @canavan_introduction_2015, 10 — quoting “Science Fiction and Empire,” in SF Studies 30.2 (July 2003)

From **Radio Enters Into a New Phase,** HG defends patents as a monopoly:  RCA holds a patent on virtually every important radio related invention.  Gernsback argues that every patent is a monopoly.  Any small set manufacturer has to pay expensive royalties, phasing out all but the largest firms.  G is strangely optimistic about this possibility:  “What has been predicted for a number of years has thus come to pass.  The radio set business will be in the hands of a few strong corporations, which will control the legitimate set business in the United States on a highly competitive basis.  All other reports to the contrary, this certainly is not a general monopoly of the set business; and we believe that, in time to come, it will work out to the advantage of the public.”  But set manufacturers are slower to change than the experimenter.

Mixing up sensory inputs: television signals become tactile and auditory sensation.  Media are synonymous with the mechanical transportation and simulation of sensory inputs.

“An interesting phenomenon in connection with television itself is that, if the output currents of the light-sensitive cell are listened to in a telephone receiver, they can be heard as sounds, and every object or scene has its own peculiar characteristic sound.  For example, the fingers of a hand held in front of the transmitter will give rise to a sound similar to the grating of a very coarse file, while the human face will cause a high-pitched whistle which will vary in pitch as the head is turned or even when the features are moved.  For experimental purposes Mr. Baird had some phonograph records made of the sounds made by different persons’ faces, and by listening carefully to the reproductions of these records it is possible to distinguish between one face and another by the sounds they make!  With practice, faces may even be recognized by the sounds produced.”^[@dinsdale_television_1927]

> In view of his own failures and successes, Gernsback told readers that professional scientists were often too timid, conventional and incredulous to recognize uncredentialed genius when they saw it.  Unfettered by the disciplinarianism of the professional environment and endowed with fresh imaginations, amateur scientists were the true inheritors of the scientific spirit, he argued. In short, even though science and invention had been professionalized and institutionalized for two decades already, amateur science was the real science; holding excellent prospects for financial reward and even opportunities for fame.^[@drown_finer_2006.]
