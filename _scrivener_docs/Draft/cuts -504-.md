Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.  Magic?

In part, this is a book about the origins of American science fiction.  It’s also a look at the emergence of new media around community practices rather than new technical standards or innovations.

Technical literacy was encouraged not only through blueprints and instruction manuals for the amateur tinkerer, but also through thought experiments and graphical projections of what these new media might look like.  This was Gernsback's forté: reading fantastic possibilities for the future of technologically advanced societies off the shape of the most mundane of material objects, techniques and processes.

In …, the addition and subtraction of each wire, condenser, or tuning hookup constituted a full-scale shift in the abilities and sensory affects of the apparatus being constructed as well as the narrative form through which it was described.

At work here is a certain form of magic, when we don’t know how something works but we can see that, plainly, it does (see Mauss).  Our suspicion is elicited, nonetheless.  …prototyping the future — understanding what the future will be like, setting up the conditions in which we can assess and critique its coming, with ready to hand, available material objects.  

"…we do not define magic in terms of the structure of its rites, but by the circumstances in which the rites occur, which in turn determine the place they occupy in the totality of social customs." (Mauss 30)

The traditional character of magic is "bound up with the arts and crafts.  The successive gestures of an artisan may be as uniformly regulated as those of a magician."  (24)

But in magic, "it is not really believed that the gestures themselves bring about the result.  The effect derives from something else, and usually this is not of the same order."  Technique, on the other hand, maintains a "homogeneity between cause and effect."  "Everyone knows that the results are achieved directly through the co-ordination of action, tool and physical agent." (25)
