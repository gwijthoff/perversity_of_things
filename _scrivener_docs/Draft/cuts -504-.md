Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.  Magic?

In part, this is a book about the origins of American science fiction.  It’s also a look at the emergence of new media around community practices rather than new technical standards or innovations.

Technical literacy was encouraged not only through blueprints and instruction manuals for the amateur tinkerer, but also through thought experiments and graphical projections of what these new media might look like.  This was Gernsback's forté: reading fantastic possibilities for the future of technologically advanced societies off the shape of the most mundane of material objects, techniques and processes.

In …, the addition and subtraction of each wire, condenser, or tuning hookup constituted a full-scale shift in the abilities and sensory affects of the apparatus being constructed as well as the narrative form through which it was described.  

In many ways, this poses a classic science fictional question: how can national borders remain in the face of a dawning global consciousness?  The answer, of course, is that these utopian dreams were themselves the product of an American public that emerged from the horrors of World War I seemingly unscathed.  What they didn't realize was that the network of large wireless relay towers whose signals were a popular draw for new and existing amateur listeners were themselves a product of the United States's nationalist ambitions in the wake of the Spanish-American War.  Wireless at that time was seen as an important tool in networking and securing the public.  (See the annotations in "Wired Radio Versus Space Radio" for more on the strategic control of submarine cables after the Spanish-American War.)

At work here is a certain form of magic, when we don’t know how something works but we can see that, plainly, it does (see Mauss).  Our suspicion is elicited, nonetheless.  …prototyping the future — understanding what the future will be like, setting up the conditions in which we can assess and critique its coming, with ready to hand, available material objects.  

"…we do not define magic in terms of the structure of its rites, but by the circumstances in which the rites occur, which in turn determine the place they occupy in the totality of social customs." (Mauss 30)

The traditional character of magic is "bound up with the arts and crafts.  The successive gestures of an artisan may be as uniformly regulated as those of a magician."  (24)

But in magic, "it is not really believed that the gestures themselves bring about the result.  The effect derives from something else, and usually this is not of the same order."  Technique, on the other hand, maintains a "homogeneity between cause and effect."  "Everyone knows that the results are achieved directly through the co-ordination of action, tool and physical agent." (25)

As a result, until 1938, when John Campbell took the editor’s chair at Astounding and transformed the class dynamics of the field, science fiction magazines are best understood in the way Michael Denning treats dime novels, as dialogic texts where mostly middle-class writers ventriloquized the working-class accents of their readers to advance their views of the world. This complex voicing, and the fact that both working-class and disaffected wage-earners wrote back to the magazines, make science fiction some of the best evidence we have of the ways a particularly beset urban group of would-be wage earners understood their prospects of attaining a middle-class life in the 1920s and 30s, and in particular how young middle-class women’s move out of the home and into self-supporting occupations affected these prospects.^[@drown_business_2006.]

“Csicsery-Ronay calls particular attention to those “fantasies of physical mastery and engineering know-how” that continue to drive so much science fiction as part and parcel of the way imperialism “facilitated the subjugation of less developed cultures, wove converging networks of technical administration, and established standards of ‘objective measurement’ that led inevitably to myths of racial and national supremacy.” @canavan_introduction_2015, 10 — quoting “Science Fiction and Empire,” in SF Studies 30.2 (July 2003)
