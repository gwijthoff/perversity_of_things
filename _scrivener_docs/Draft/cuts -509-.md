Osophone

=========

An interesting article from the January 1916 issue of *Electrical Experimenter* recommends that the reader tries biting a sewing needle tightly between his teeth and holding the sharp end to the groove of a phonograph record.

> With a little practise one will become proficient in moving the head at the same ratio of speed as the ordinary reproducer arm is moved from the outside of the record towards the inside. As soon as the needle touches the record with sufficient pressure, the inside of the head will be filled immediately with music exceedingly loud and clear. A curious result of the experiment is that a person standing near by can bear the music, the head acting as a reproducer in this case.  (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**)

(This author, having successfully performed this experiment himself, for legal reasons probably shouldn't recommend that the reader try this at home.)  When the same experiment reappears later in the same issue, it's during an installment of *The Scientific Adventures of Baron MÃ¼nchausen* as a means of describing a very strange Martian technology, the Tos Rod.  

listening "not with their ears. They were listening with their brains!"

> The two reddish plates pressing against the bare temples are made of two metals unknown on earth, and the metals are distributed over the surface of the plate in honeycomb fashion without touching each other. Now if the two plates are pressed against the temples and when wireless waves are passing through them, the waves are translated into vibrations of a certain frequency. It has been found that if these vibrations reach the conscious sense of hearing which is located in the *Temporal Lobe* of the brain, sounds can be impressed upon the brain without requiring the ear and its auditory nerve. In other words, the sound is "heard" directly within the brain without the agency of the ear's mechanism.

Gernsback assures the reader that the ear is not "absolutely essential for hearing," and to illustrate his point describes the same sewing needle experiment.

Seven years later, Gernsback would patent a device he called the Osophone, a "small, compact and handy instrument which can be easily carried about and used without attracting undue attention."  The Osophone employed the same principle as the *Electrical Experimental* editorial, this time with a finished mouthpiece attached to a wire that provided a "simple and practical means by which hearing may be effected by sound vibrations transmitted directly to the osseous tissue of the body."

The example of the Osophone illustrates how tinkering with something as simple as available household materials became the starting point for new inventions, both functional and fictional.  Describing the operation of a particular technology was a means of aiding design practice, even when that design practice was a form of narrative speculation.

after "never trust our senses"

=========================

Given the rate of this "progress," the reader should not be surprised if the next great scientific advance, seemingly impossible today, should become commonplace tomorrow.  Over the course of Gernsback's writings, this faith in technoscientific progress remains remarkably unscathed in the wake of the First World War and the Depression, a faith that only an American technologist could claim, at a remove from the horrors of the trenches and doubling down with the idea that cultural welfare could be technocratically managed by machines and their engineers (**Human Progress; Wonders of the Machine Age**).

productivist bias

===============

In cultural studies of media and technology today, we might think of these two styles of invention as Gernsback formulates them -- the whole cloth innovation of shiny new tools versus incremental acts of modification and repair -- as reflections of a hemispheric divide.  Steven J. Jackson argues that "a Western and productivist imagination" biases much of media studies today, obscuring the vast majority of technological practices in the developing world:  "breakdown, maintenance, and repair constitute crucial but vastly understudied sites or moments within the worlds of new media and technology today."^[For more on "the distinctive repair ecologies of the developing world," see @jackson_rethinking_2014.]
