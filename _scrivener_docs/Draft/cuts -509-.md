Osophone

=========

An interesting article from the January 1916 issue of *Electrical Experimenter* recommends that the reader tries biting a sewing needle tightly between his teeth and holding the sharp end to the groove of a phonograph record.

> With a little practise one will become proficient in moving the head at the same ratio of speed as the ordinary reproducer arm is moved from the outside of the record towards the inside. As soon as the needle touches the record with sufficient pressure, the inside of the head will be filled immediately with music exceedingly loud and clear. A curious result of the experiment is that a person standing near by can bear the music, the head acting as a reproducer in this case.  (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**)

(I was actually planning on testing out this experiment when… alas… I lost my chompers.  But if you go home, try it, and get hurt, don't say it was me who told you to do it.)  When the same experiment reappears later in the same issue, it's during an installment of *The Scientific Adventures of Baron Münchausen* as a means of describing a very strange Martian technology, the Tos Rod.  

listening "not with their ears. They were listening with their brains!"

> The two reddish plates pressing against the bare temples are made of two metals unknown on earth, and the metals are distributed over the surface of the plate in honeycomb fashion without touching each other. Now if the two plates are pressed against the temples and when wireless waves are passing through them, the waves are translated into vibrations of a certain frequency. It has been found that if these vibrations reach the conscious sense of hearing which is located in the *Temporal Lobe* of the brain, sounds can be impressed upon the brain without requiring the ear and its auditory nerve. In other words, the sound is "heard" directly within the brain without the agency of the ear's mechanism.

Gernsback assures the reader that the ear is not "absolutely essential for hearing," and to illustrate his point describes the same sewing needle experiment.

Seven years later, Gernsback would patent a device he called the Osophone, a "small, compact and handy instrument which can be easily carried about and used without attracting undue attention."  The Osophone employed the same principle as the *Electrical Experimental* editorial, this time with a finished mouthpiece attached to a wire that provided a "simple and practical means by which hearing may be effected by sound vibrations transmitted directly to the osseous tissue of the body."

after "never trust our senses"

=========================

Given the rate of this "progress," the reader should not be surprised if the next great scientific advance, seemingly impossible today, should become commonplace tomorrow.  Over the course of Gernsback's writings, this faith in technoscientific progress remains remarkably unscathed in the wake of the First World War and the Depression, a faith that only an American technologist could claim, at a remove from the horrors of the trenches and doubling down with the idea that cultural welfare could be technocratically managed by machines and their engineers (**Human Progress; Wonders of the Machine Age**).

productivist bias

===============

In cultural studies of media and technology today, we might think of these two styles of invention as Gernsback formulates them -- the whole cloth innovation of shiny new tools versus incremental acts of modification and repair -- as reflections of a hemispheric divide.  Steven J. Jackson argues that "a Western and productivist imagination" biases much of media studies today, obscuring the vast majority of technological practices in the developing world:  "breakdown, maintenance, and repair constitute crucial but vastly understudied sites or moments within the worlds of new media and technology today."^[For more on "the distinctive repair ecologies of the developing world," see @jackson_rethinking_2014.]

autism

The essays that follow are representative of a discussion among overlapping publics that sometimes explicitly occluded certain groups and at others offered a way in for the otherwise occluded voices of women and, in the argument of Steve Silberman, allowed people on the Autism spectrum to 

> Both amateur radio and science fiction fandom offered ways of gaining social recognition outside traditional channels. . . . For people who found open-ended conversations daunting, the byzantine customs and rituals of fandom furnished reassuring scripts for interaction. 

> By routing around the face-to-face interactions they found so daunting, even people who found it nearly impossible to communicate through speech were able to reach out to kindred spirits, find potential mentors, and gain the skills and confidence they needed to become productive members of society.^[@silberman_neurotribes:_2015]

sexology

=========

and later, in *Sexology* (1933), a relatively progressive treatment of masturbation, homosexuality, and premarital sex into the 1950s and 60s, although articles on "breastfeeding fathers, women with extra breasts, Hitler's sex life, [and] rubber fetishism" were more common.^[Though it's outside the scope of this volume, for a selection of articles from this magazine see @yoe_best_2008.]

jewish identity

=============

Reputation:  "a disastrous (if not a pernicious) figure, a man whose stultifying vision and lack of literary taste led to the establishment of a literature that for too many years was considered a laughingstock, that emphasized other elements than literary quality, and, perhaps worse of all, that paid the majority of its writers badly."^[@grossman_hugo_2011]  Attention to the poor rates he paid his writers (a common gripe among pulp authors and their editors) that has more than a little hint of antisemitism to it -- the spectacularly racist H.P. Lovecraft's monicker "Hugo the Rat" stuck with Gernsback and, even while many commentators don't embrace the name, they do cite the poor wages he paid as if it's evidence of his character.  a Jewish identity that, like many Jewish immigrants to the United States, Gernsback never fully embraced.  (say this in a way that doesn't implicate the cited author as himself being antisemitic…)

A Jewish immigrant in search of a respectability that always seemed to elude him, as a Jew, pigeonholed as a "pulp" editor,  (see @fingeroth_disguised_2009)
