“For interwar science fiction, ‘amazing,’ ‘astounding,’ and ‘wonder’ were more than magazine titles; they were also metaphors for a specific style to imagine science, clarion calls for its conversation.  … Gernsback developed a view of participatory science before he began his science fiction ventures…” @cheng_astounding_2012

See 192008 “Science and Invention” on G’s definition of science as what the average person understands, not the expert.

	That "science" and "invention" are part of the same process, drawing on the Latin etymology of the terms.  But "invention" precedes science.  It is a form of instinctual know-how or "knack," a term Gernsback frequently returns to.  Repeats the idea that science is everywhere now in daily life, with modern conveniences.

	"science no longer is the sombre book closed with seven seals.  Quite the contrary, it is the public that popularizes science---not our scientists."  

But then makes this interesting turn, saying that scientists are themselves backwards, because they don't accept fantastic dreamers.

> But our *real* scientists are as backward as in Galileo's times.  The public applauds and instantly believes in anything new that is scientific, whereas the true scientist scoffs and jeers, just as he did in Galileo's times when that worthy stoutly maintained that the earth moved and did not stand still.

See next 192310 “The New Science and Invention” on how he sees the magazine’s role in popular science

	"The reason is that the average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of text of scientific facts, which means concentration and study. With fiction, however, this does not hold true because fiction is an entertainment; it does not require study. On the other hand, *we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study.*"
