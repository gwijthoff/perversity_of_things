Delany mentioned in a conversation that pulp editors were often Jewish, hardback, "literary" publishers Protestant.  A big part of HG's identity here, and a meaningful silence on his identity.

Lead in with list of authors from the nineteenth century that Gernsback championed, yet who were largely unknown.  What it means to hide identity…

(**An American Jules Verne**)

Luis Philip Senarens (1863-1939), a Brooklyn-based Cuban American, was one of the few dime novel authors to be known by his given name, beyond the pseudonym he published under: "Noname."  Considering Samuel R. Delany's comments on what we lose along with authorial identities in the history of science fiction, Senarens's background is especially interesting:

> I believe I first heard Harlan Ellison make the point that we know of dozens upon dozens of early pulp writers only as names: They conducted their careers entirely by mail---in a field and during an era when pen names were the rule rather than the exception.  Among the 'Remington C. Scotts' and the 'Frank P. Joneses' who litter the contents pages of the early pulps, we simply have no way of knowing if one, three, or seven of them---or even many more---were blacks, Hispanics, women, Native Americans, Asians, or whatever.  Writing is like that.  

@delany_racism_2000

It would be nice if Senarens could prove the exception to this rule.  Much like Lisa Yaszek's work on the hundreds of female authors (many publishing under male pen names) for whom writing science fiction in postwar suburban America was "virtually the only vehicle of political dissent," one wishes that Senarens as a Cuban author could shed light on marginalized communities that participated (as editors, readers, storytellers) in the otherwise suffocatingly white male world of dime novel---and later pulp---fiction.  @yaszek_galactic_2008, p. 3, quoting Judith Merril.

Unfortunately, Senarens's work is in fact a distillation of the absolute worst tendencies of the dime novels' virulent racism and gleeful violence.  E.F. Bleiler's catalogue barely scratches the surface: "sadism, a rancorous disparaging of all races with the exception of WASPS, factual ignorance, coarse imperialist clichés about Manifest Destiny and the right of the White Man to rule the world." @bleiler_senarens_2014

Of course, as a genre writer, one's work must inherently fit within a given paradigm.  But take, for instance, Senarens's first Reade title, *Frank Reade, Jr. and His Steam Wonder,* in which the teenaged protagonist and his friends (including Pomp, "the darkey who had accompanied Frank Reade, Sr., on so many of his wild escapades") massacre two hundred Native Americans in minutes, circling around the group in the Steam Wonder, a tank armed with repeating rifles and cannons that shoot boiling water.  When it is done, they "rejoice":

> "Hanged if that doesn't clear the field!" cried Sam Watson, in the greatest glee.  "The whole gang is busted!"

> "Yes," remarked Jack, "we can lick a thousand as well as a hundred, for they can't get in, you know."

> Why in thunder and chain lightning don't Uncle Sam buy a lot of these machines, and run 'em out here?" demanded Watson.  "They'd clear the plains of red-skins so quick it would make their heads swim.

@senarens_frank_1893, p. 15.

The dime novel paradigm is a precursor that many histories of science fiction would gladly speed past.  But one wonders the degree to which this predecessor is still with the genre, considering just how many of us have played out the exact tactics of Senarens's Steam Wonder tank scenario in SF-themed first person shooter video games.

Rieder, Colonialism and SF:  “Thus the advent of the sspectacular invention inevitably invokes that embracing pattern of uneven economic and cultural distribution, colonialism, and with it arises the specter of those encounters between cultures with wildly different technological capabilities that produced during this period some of the most one-sided armed conflicts in human history.  Behind the anxieties of competition between capitalist corporations and imperialist governments in stories of marvelous invention, lurks the possibility of finding oneself reduced by someone else’s progress to the helplessness of those who are unable to inhabit the present fully, and whose continued existence on any terms other than those of the conquerors has been rendered an archaism and anomaly.  Colonial invasion is the dark counter-image of technological revolution.  In relation to technology, as in other contexts, the history, ideology, and discourses of colonialism dovetail with the crucial, double perspective that runs throughout the genre:  on one hand, the wondrous exploration of the new and the marvelous encounter with the strange, but on he other, the post-apocalyptic vision of a world gone disastrously wrong.” (32-3)
