History/tradition of scientifiction

    As early as 1915, Gernsback cites nineteenth century dime novels like *Deadwood Dick* and authors like Luis Senarens ("The American Jules Verne"), revealing an awareness of the genealogy of science fiction over a decade before the launch of *Amazing Stories* in 1926, when most SF critics locate the birth of the genre.  These essays make clear that a very sophisticated understanding of the genre's roots was already in place by the 1910s, and that science fiction as we understand it today was a rich and variegated series of activities, rather than merely a literary form.

    191511_bookworm_patent -- an understanding of the 19th century precursors, the tradition on which his magazines built.  Also, an understanding that his readers were ravenous.

    192604_a_new_sort -- 200 years ago, these kind of stories were impossible without "science," which now enters so intimately into our daily lives.  So we take this science for granted, but the role of scientifiction is to teach us without being aware of being taught.

As Gary Westfahl has persuasively argued, Gernsback not only set up the conditions in which a genre of science fiction could flourish, he also cited and republished the work of nineteenth century authors in an attempt to establish a tradition.  

In addition to his appreciation for Luis Senarens and Clement Fezandié, Gernsback reprinted stories by Richard Adams Locke and Fitz James O'Brien.  Frequently mentioned nineteenth century authors mentioned in the pages of *Amazing* included H. Rider Haggard, Edward Bellamy, Garrett P. Serviss, M.P. Shiel, and Arthur Conan Doyle.  Contrary to later histories of science fiction that emphasized texts commenting on the social or political context from which they emerged, Gernsback's canon revolves around prognostication.  Westfahl: 

    > In associating writers whose careers began in the 19th century with SF, Gernsback, unlike later historians, did not attribute their work to larger events in that era; they were rather persons ahead of their time, 'prophets' who anticipated both the value of scientific progress and the value of literature about scientific progress.  All on his own, Poe 'conceive[d] the idea of a scientific story.'  Thus, according to Gernsback, 19th-century SF was simply the product of isolated individual geniuses. (@westfahl_jules_1992, p. 242-3)

In **The Lure of Scientifiction,** Gernsback argues that this kind of storytelling can be traced all the way back to Leonardo Da Vinci and Francis Bacon.  

Luis Senarens, Clement Fezandié.

was a historian of science fiction as well as a founder of the genre, referencing H.G. Wells, Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne and the lesser known Luis Senarens in some of his first editorials for *Amazing Stories* (see **A New Sort of Magazine** and **The Lure of Scientifiction**).  @westfahl_jules_1992.

He was, in a sense, the genre's founding father as well as its first historian.

See **Phoney Patent Offizz: Bookworm’s Nurse**).

But the fact that this spoof depicts an insatiable reader holding a copy of *Deadwood Dick* suggests that Gernsback and his colleagues were aware of an even broader tradition upon which they built.  *Deadwood Dick* was a series of dime novel westerns written by Edward L. Wheeler from 1877-1885.  The series' titular character lived on under ghostwriters from 1886-1897.  Wheeler "wore a Stetson hat, and is said to have greeted even strangers as 'pard.'"  @johannsen_house_1950, available online at Northern Illinois University Libraries's Beadle and Adams Dime Novel Digitization Project, <http://www.ulib.niu.edu/badndp/>.

Dime novels serve as an important precursor to magazine era science fiction both materially---printed on very cheap paper and "sent to the army in the field by cords, like unsaved firewood" during the American Civil War---and thematically---featuring stories of marvels, lost races, and inventions like Edward S. Ellis's *Steam Man of the Prairies.*  See @jencks_dime_1904; @bleiler_newark_1989.  

Pulp publishing begins with Frank Munsey’s Argosy magazine in 1895.  Pulp publishing “was a revolution in industrial mass production that capitalized on North America’s vastly increased immigrant population, its decline in illiteracy rates, its rural postal delivery, and its increased urbanization.” (Ross 106)  Munsey was a former telegraph operator.

Unfortunately, these "enemies" were almost always signaled through ethnic markers.  Everett F. Bleiler, in his entry on the dime novel in the *Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,* writes:

    

> These stories, together with [Edward S.] Ellis's work, set the pattern for future invention stories. The initial model was the dime-novel Western. Stress was on iron technology, with little or no science; narratives contained random, thrilling incidents, often presented in a disjointed and puerile way. Typical social patterns were: a conscious attempt to capitalize on age conflict, with boy inventors outdoing their elders (Edisonade); aggressive, exploitative capitalism, particularly at the expense of "primitive" peoples; the frontier mentality, with slaughter of "primitives" (in the first Frank Reade, Jr. story Frank kills about 250 Native Americans, to say nothing of destroying an inhabited village); strong elements of sadism; ethnic rancour focused on Native Americans, blacks, Irish and, later, Mexicans and Jews.

Lead in with list of authors from the nineteenth century that Gernsback championed, yet who were largely unknown.  What it means to hide identity…

(**An American Jules Verne**)

Luis Philip Senarens (1863-1939), a Brooklyn-based Cuban American, was one of the few dime novel authors to be known by his given name, beyond the pseudonym he published under: "Noname."  Considering Samuel R. Delany's comments on what we lose along with authorial identities in the history of science fiction, Senarens's background is especially interesting:

> I believe I first heard Harlan Ellison make the point that we know of dozens upon dozens of early pulp writers only as names: They conducted their careers entirely by mail---in a field and during an era when pen names were the rule rather than the exception.  Among the 'Remington C. Scotts' and the 'Frank P. Joneses' who litter the contents pages of the early pulps, we simply have no way of knowing if one, three, or seven of them---or even many more---were blacks, Hispanics, women, Native Americans, Asians, or whatever.  Writing is like that.  

@delany_racism_2000

It would be nice if Senarens could prove the exception to this rule.  Much like Lisa Yaszek's work on the hundreds of female authors (many publishing under male pen names) for whom writing science fiction in postwar suburban America was "virtually the only vehicle of political dissent," one wishes that Senarens as a Cuban author could shed light on marginalized communities that participated (as editors, readers, storytellers) in the otherwise suffocatingly white male world of dime novel---and later pulp---fiction.  @yaszek_galactic_2008, p. 3, quoting Judith Merril.

Unfortunately, Senarens's work is in fact a distillation of the absolute worst tendencies of the dime novels' virulent racism and gleeful violence.  E.F. Bleiler's catalogue barely scratches the surface: "sadism, a rancorous disparaging of all races with the exception of WASPS, factual ignorance, coarse imperialist clichés about Manifest Destiny and the right of the White Man to rule the world." @bleiler_senarens_2014

Of course, as a genre writer, one's work must inherently fit within a given paradigm.  But take, for instance, Senarens's first Reade title, *Frank Reade, Jr. and His Steam Wonder,* in which the teenaged protagonist and his friends (including Pomp, "the darkey who had accompanied Frank Reade, Sr., on so many of his wild escapades") massacre two hundred Native Americans in minutes, circling around the group in the Steam Wonder, a tank armed with repeating rifles and cannons that shoot boiling water.  When it is done, they "rejoice":

> "Hanged if that doesn't clear the field!" cried Sam Watson, in the greatest glee.  "The whole gang is busted!"

> "Yes," remarked Jack, "we can lick a thousand as well as a hundred, for they can't get in, you know."

> Why in thunder and chain lightning don't Uncle Sam buy a lot of these machines, and run 'em out here?" demanded Watson.  "They'd clear the plains of red-skins so quick it would make their heads swim.

@senarens_frank_1893, p. 15.

The dime novel paradigm is a precursor that many histories of science fiction would gladly speed past.  But one wonders the degree to which this predecessor is still with the genre, considering just how many of us have played out the exact tactics of Senarens's Steam Wonder tank scenario in SF-themed first person shooter video games.

Rieder, Colonialism and SF:  “Thus the advent of the sspectacular invention inevitably invokes that embracing pattern of uneven economic and cultural distribution, colonialism, and with it arises the specter of those encounters between cultures with wildly different technological capabilities that produced during this period some of the most one-sided armed conflicts in human history.  Behind the anxieties of competition between capitalist corporations and imperialist governments in stories of marvelous invention, lurks the possibility of finding oneself reduced by someone else’s progress to the helplessness of those who are unable to inhabit the present fully, and whose continued existence on any terms other than those of the conquerors has been rendered an archaism and anomaly.  Colonial invasion is the dark counter-image of technological revolution.  In relation to technology, as in other contexts, the history, ideology, and discourses of colonialism dovetail with the crucial, double perspective that runs throughout the genre:  on one hand, the wondrous exploration of the new and the marvelous encounter with the strange, but on he other, the post-apocalyptic vision of a world gone disastrously wrong.” (32-3)

Ralph's antagonist is "black", the Martian.

Race and martians:  Ferdinand the Martian is “black, he was black all over.”  Ask about his face, which store proprietor says was also black, before he says Martian was “covered wit ha black cloth.”  The Martians have technologies far beyond the ken of even Ralph.  The only people who could outsmart him, he concludes, are the Martians.  165

Ross, “universal” language of science for white men and boys only.  “In particular, this language functioned as a mark of the heroes’ superiority in coping with conditions in exotic localities like Mars or Venus, whose climates were simply displaced from the popular action-adventure regions of the arid West and tropical Africa respectively.”
