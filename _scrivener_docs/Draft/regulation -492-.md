regulation [pithy phrase]

======================

This can be either an introduction section (if there's really enough meat to make an entire section out of, which I doubt) or just a TOC heading, which would probably be better.  This allows for more granular TOC headings, and articles appearing in multiple categories.

"out into the star-lit night and myriads of voices" 191906_amateur_radio_restored

Do these articles amount to a full scale policy or philosophy of regulation?  Probably not.  More a series of reactions to conditions on the ground.  Tries to remain as agnostic as possible.

## Broadcast regulation

> *Activism, community organization, and manifestos written in service of radio amateur rights after the US government banned all public wireless activities in the wake of World War I; includes later writings for the Technocracy movement.*

With the outbreak of World War I, the U.S. Navy outlawed all amateur wireless broadcasting activities and took sole control of the airwaves.  *Modern Electrics* thus became a community forum for frustrations over this policy, as well as a drawing board for what broadcast regulation should look like once the war was over.  Gernsback and his associates formed "The Wireless Association of America" in 1910, an education and outreach organization that ended up training many of the wireless operators that the Navy would need once the U.S. entered the war, one of who even developed a means of recording clandestine German U-boat commands that were being relayed through a New Jersey wireless station, unbeknownst to the U.S. Government ("Sayville").  As Gernsback liked to proudly claim later in life, language from his *Modern Electrics* editorial on broadcast regulation ("The Alexander Wireless Bill") was eventually taken up by the Congress's Wireless Act of 1912.  Finally, as Tim Wu writes, *Radio News* later served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country's history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and "what one might expect to hear on them -- a forerunner of the once hugely profitable *TV Guide.*"^[@wu_master_2010, 39.]

Gernsback would later re-enter policy debates and the politics of technology with his short-lived *Technocracy Review,* which featured essays by the leaders of the Technocracy, Inc. movement.  People like Howard Scott argued that a small elite of technologically-inclined leaders, by dint of their mathematical and engineering expertise, would be able to govern the country more rationally, economically, and fairly.  Gernsback's editorials for this magazine provide an overview of the idea as it gained currency after the stock market crash ("The Machine and the Depression").
