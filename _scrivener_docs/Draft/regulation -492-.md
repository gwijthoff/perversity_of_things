regulation [pithy phrase]

======================

This can be either an introduction section (if there's really enough meat to make an entire section out of, which I doubt) or just a TOC heading, which would probably be better.  This allows for more granular TOC headings, and articles appearing in multiple categories.

OR, use brief stuff on regulation as a pivot point between a section on wireless, and another section on HG’s social ideology through technology, as a technocrat and a utopian.

"A perfect Babel of voices" 191906_amateur_radio_restored

"out into the star-lit night and myriads of voices" 191906_amateur_radio_restored

Do these articles amount to a full scale policy or philosophy of regulation?  Probably not.  More a series of reactions to conditions on the ground.  Tries to remain as agnostic as possible.

social ideology

--------------------

Managing capitalism’s excesses through technocracy:  “While some genre SF suggests a need to restrain capitalist excesses, this typically takes the form not of democratic contorl but of technocratic management and engineering inverventions, as in Robert A. Heinlein’s “The Roads Must Roll” (1940) and George O. Smith’s Venus Equilateral stories (1942-7).  More commonly, from Hugo Gernsback’s Ralph 124C 41+: A Romance of the Year 2660 (1911-12) onward, SF normalizes capitalism by assuming its endless unquestioned perpetuation, a tendency that leads Bruce Sterling’s Schismatrix (1985) for example, to treat neoliberal economics as if they are laws of physics.” (Mark Bould in Cambridge Companion to US SF, p. 87)

“Csicsery-Ronay calls particular attention to those “fantasies of physical mastery and engineering know-how” that continue to drive os much science fiction as part and parcel of the way imperlalism “facilitated the subjugation of less developed cultures, wove converging networks of technical administration, and established standards of ‘objective measurement’ that led inevitably to myths of racial and national supremacy.” @canavan_introduction_2015, 10 — quoting “Science Fiction and Empire,” in SF Studies 30.2 (July 2003)

Less faith in progress than one might otherwise think?  Reminds readers that the gains made by progress are fragile, and could be taken away at any moment.  "The penalty of our present civiliztion is that it makes us soft and without resistance.” From 192210_human_progress

But here, about as positivist as you can get, in 193107_wonders_machine_age: "Famines, pestilence and other scourges were the usual thing long before the Machine Age, when there was no machine to put the blame on. Today, thanks to the Machine Age, we no longer have country-wide famines of the severity of the past; and thanks to science, we no longer have the scourges and pestilences that our ancestors had to contend with. Quick communication by rail, water, and air, tends to do away with both acute famine and widespread diseases.”  States that “science fiction is based upon the progress of science; THAT IS ITS VERY FOUNDATION. Without it, there could be no science fiction.”  Faith in technological progress is synonymous with SF, for Gernsback.  Adds that if we go back to a Middle Age, the Machine Age will not be the cause of it.  Humans will

regulation & activism

-----------------------------

"However, the competition magazine, Electrician and Mechanic, soon adopted this idea and founded a club of radio amateurs named The Wireless Club.”  @tesla_reprint_2007

## Broadcast regulation

> *Activism, community organization, and manifestos written in service of radio amateur rights after the US government banned all public wireless activities in the wake of World War I; includes later writings for the Technocracy movement.*

With the outbreak of World War I, the U.S. Navy outlawed all amateur wireless broadcasting activities and took sole control of the airwaves.  *Modern Electrics* thus became a community forum for frustrations over this policy, as well as a drawing board for what broadcast regulation should look like once the war was over.  Gernsback and his associates formed "The Wireless Association of America" in 1910, an education and outreach organization that ended up training many of the wireless operators that the Navy would need once the U.S. entered the war, one of who even developed a means of recording clandestine German U-boat commands that were being relayed through a New Jersey wireless station, unbeknownst to the U.S. Government ("Sayville").  As Gernsback liked to proudly claim later in life, language from his *Modern Electrics* editorial on broadcast regulation ("The Alexander Wireless Bill") was eventually taken up by the Congress's Wireless Act of 1912.  Finally, as Tim Wu writes, *Radio News* later served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country's history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and "what one might expect to hear on them -- a forerunner of the once hugely profitable *TV Guide.*"^[@wu_master_2010, 39.]

Gernsback would later re-enter policy debates and the politics of technology with his short-lived *Technocracy Review,* which featured essays by the leaders of the Technocracy, Inc. movement.  People like Howard Scott argued that a small elite of technologically-inclined leaders, by dint of their mathematical and engineering expertise, would be able to govern the country more rationally, economically, and fairly.  Gernsback's editorials for this magazine provide an overview of the idea as it gained currency after the stock market crash ("The Machine and the Depression").

“Unquestionably the entire credit for obtaining the amateur’s rights belongs to *Modern Electrics*” (**Wireless and the Amateur: A Retrospect**, February 1913)
