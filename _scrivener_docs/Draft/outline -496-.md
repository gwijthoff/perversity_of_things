Israel, discussing Layton's "Mirror-Image Twin" article on the development of engineering science in the 19th century:  "Rather than creating fundamental knowledge of the natural world, engineering theories were intended to describe the behavior of particular technologies in order to aid design practice."  Distinctions between knowledge, theory, and design that obviously become blurred.  @israel_machine_1992, 187
