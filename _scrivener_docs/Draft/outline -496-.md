	✓	on sci vs tech: Edwin Layton, "Mirror-Image Twins: The Communities of Science and Technology in 19th Century America," 1971

	✓	Layton, "Technology as Knowledge," T&C 1974

	✓	Lessig, technology moving faster than the law

Define terms:

	◦	fantastic (Todorov, Callois)

BIG POINTS

	•	SF comes from hands-on tinkering

	⁃	knowledge thru the hands

	⁃	everyday life

	•	an origin point for media studies

	•	"science" a contested entity amid the popularization of science

	•	occluded and contested identities for women and minorities in these communities

	•	The opening section should be a condensation of the introduction, hitting all of the main points: SF as making, early media theory, speculative science

	•	[opening]

	•	(2 days)

x	⁃	Coggeshall's handicraft and Gernsback's storytelling.  From a physical medium of metal filings to a social medium of radio.

x	⁃	This is the story of a literary genre's emergence, but not one that the reader is familiar with.  SF began much earlier than AS, and not primarily as a literary phenomenon but an understanding of everyday technology through making and tinkering.

x	⁃	Describe the magazines and their contents, as well as what this selection of HG's work represents.

	⁃	more on the focus on HG over the whole community?

x	⁃	During this period, key objects of SF like science, media, and technology were in flux.  A media theory in the making, based on affordances of small components.

x	⁃	Coexistence of very different modes: radically practical, and radically speculative.

x	⁃	Radically practical: the Telimco was finicky, but its technical details, its easy functioning, became a platform for speculation about futures that felt immanent.

x	⁃	Radically speculative: within the history of popular science magazines, this one blurred the lines between the real and the imaginary.  HG magazines made the scandalous seem possible.

	⁃	Because of this mixture of practical and speculative, these futures felt possible, like they could be made.  Handicraft futures, similar to Mauss's concept of magic.  This was the "perversity of things."

	⁃	HG and his community, occluded groups.  He wasn't an inventor like Edison or Jobs, but his career left us with a way of participating in and debating technological change.

	•	"up-to-date technic": Media Theory in the Making  [bio and magazine context]

	•	(1 day)

x	⁃	personal background

x	⁃	beginnings of Modern Electrics, its authors

x	⁃	defining "science" through the public. also, on "technology"

	⁃	not too much on science in the everyday, as this will go into the SF section

x	⁃	beginning of Electrical Experimenter. Paul's illustrations and their international spread

	•	"'phone and code": Wireless, Television, and Other Emerging Media

	•	1 week

[[On whether or not amateurs made important contributions to the development of these new media.  Not a brief history of radio, but of the importance of amateurs through the lens of what kind of inventions Gernsback made.  The Radioson = dubious claims?  The dynamophone = a trickster solution.  Not a piecemeal inventor, but a tinkerer whose inventions have a quirkiness, a sense of humor.]]

	⁃	x	⁃	How do new media emerge, and how do we understand their history?

	⁃	x	⁃	The idea that media "evolve", that they have platonic forms

	⁃	x	⁃	They develop within communities

	⁃	What was the makeup of this community?

	⁃	wireless

	⁃	tech optimism after WWI and Span Civil War

	⁃	wireless as an intellectual phenomenon, linking moving humanity to stationary. were women part of this community?

	⁃	initially, the amateur avant garde in development of radio

	⁃	response after being left out of the broadcast boom

	⁃	television

	⁃	corporations hoarding patents, when a community of amateurs would help the art progress faster

	•	"a perfect Babel of voices":  Broadcast Regulation, Amateur Advocacy, and Technocracy  [regulation and social ideology]

	•	[[reframe to solely consist of an analysis of the "public" or the "community" that constituted emerging media.  This can begin more slowly then, with a look at what "media theory" was for Gernsback.  First, how he takes multiple perspectives on an issue, then the section pivots into who these users/readers were.]]

	•	1 week

	⁃	what rules govern citizens of the ether?

	⁃	history of broadcast regulation

	⁃	rapidly changing technology makes law obsolete

	⁃	technological utopianism / positivism

	⁃	fantasies of physical mastery, science = manhood

	⁃	imperialism and racial supremacy

	⁃	technocracy: managing capitalism's excesses

	⁃	suffragists and radio

	•	“certain future instrumentalities”: Tinkering and Mineral Proficiencies [tinkering]

	•	3 hours

x	⁃	osophone / martians / sewing needle

	⁃	what is tinkering/inventing/mucking around 1910?

	⁃	Context: amateur inventor amid corporate r&d

x	⁃	knack, rolling sets of expertise / mineral proficiencies

x	⁃	HG's inventions in magazine pages: advertisement? brag? community?

	⁃	WRNY

x	⁃	invention vs. "philosophical research" about the future, according to Edison

	⁃	material possibility of an invention before it exists

x	•	"we exploit the future": Scientifiction's Debut [SF]

x	⁃	smooth transition from tech to SF magazines

	⁃	basic structure: an idea and its technical feasibility

x	⁃	Gernsback's own stories are the prototype

x	⁃	Gernsback not really a literary critic, but a technologist and community organizer.  His definitions come from community feedback/negotiation

x	⁃	Wertenbaker: proportion of science to fiction, fact to theory. Genre begins around a problem to be solved.

x	⁃	HG's own definitions: what counts as fact and theory, and their proportions, changes with time

x	⁃	A faith in technical progress that means there is no such thing as fiction.  All ficiton is possible, all part of the same generic continuum.  In line with some critical commentators today.

x	⁃	A spectrum of probability within the fantastic, and the best SF stories are "probable," with technically gifted writers.  These works of science fiction gradually decay into science faction as their predicitons come to be realized.

x	⁃	Imagination as a form of invention.

x	⁃	Were the "inventions" of 19thC proto-SF scientifiction? No, they couldn't be verified by a community.

x	⁃	19thC - > race -> women in SF

	⁃	Whose future was being imagined? (don't have to pivot on 19C, but maybe on whose future, and who was deciding)

x	⁃	educational aims

	⁃	shifting discourse on science

	⁃	education through wonder

Israel, discussing Layton's "Mirror-Image Twin" article on the development of engineering science in the 19th century:  "Rather than creating fundamental knowledge of the natural world, engineering theories were intended to describe the behavior of particular technologies in order to aid design practice."  Distinctions between knowledge, theory, and design that obviously become blurred.  @israel_machine_1992, 187

How does the above quote describe a form of science fiction, or the genre in its nascent form?
