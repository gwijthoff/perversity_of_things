	⁃	Coggeshall's handicraft and Gernsback's storytelling

	⁃	HG as founder of SF, and yes, this scene reads as a form of SF, telling stories about a technology.  The Telimco was finicky, barely worked.

	⁃	But more: teaching and thinking about how to make the most fantastic of futures by hand.  Handicraft futures.  (don't make it: you think this is a parable about X, but really, it's about Y)

	⁃	The rise of popular science, its relationship to magic.

	⁃	Brief overview of Electro Importing's magazines, their development, what they contained

	⁃	Introduce my book.

	⁃	

	⁃	The gap between technical realities and narrative exposition, storyboarding, storytelling

	⁃	knowledge through one’s hands, through the nerves.  and not just knowledge, but understanding the future

	⁃	MAKE SURE that it's clear this is an argument not just about the emergence of SF, but an early media theory.  A discourse on media as it played out in everyday life that drew on applied forms of speculative science.

	⁃	The opening should be a condensation of the introduction, hitting all of the main points: SF as making, early media theory, speculative science
