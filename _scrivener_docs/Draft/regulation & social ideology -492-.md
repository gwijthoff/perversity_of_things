"a perfect Babel of voices"

======================

As these newly minted citizens of the ether stepped "out into the star-lit night and myriads of voices" (**Amateur Radio Restored**), what would be the social and legal pacts that held them together, by which they organized their conversations?

HG’s social ideology through technology, as a technocrat and a utopian.

Do these articles amount to a full scale policy or philosophy of regulation?  Probably not.  More a series of reactions to conditions on the ground.  Tries to remain as agnostic as possible.

For an early "information wants to be free" argument, see 192707 Wired Radio Versus Space Radio.  Nothing super quotable, can just paraphrase his arguments.  It's also like the contrast between OTA television and cable, and the idea that amateurs will always find a way to pirate content, no matter what.  So many of the twentieth century's debates over the social use of mass media and whether or not that use is at odds with corporate interests, already played themselves out in the opening decades of the century.

Grundy's letter about saving the amateur, 192302: "It stills a thirst for scientific knowledge and hence stimulates manhood."  science = manhood

Managing capitalism’s excesses through technocracy:  “While some genre SF suggests a need to restrain capitalist excesses, this typically takes the form not of democratic contorl but of technocratic management and engineering inverventions, as in Robert A. Heinlein’s “The Roads Must Roll” (1940) and George O. Smith’s Venus Equilateral stories (1942-7).  More commonly, from Hugo Gernsback’s Ralph 124C 41+: A Romance of the Year 2660 (1911-12) onward, SF normalizes capitalism by assuming its endless unquestioned perpetuation, a tendency that leads Bruce Sterling’s Schismatrix (1985) for example, to treat neoliberal economics as if they are laws of physics.” (Mark Bould in Cambridge Companion to US SF, p. 87)

“Csicsery-Ronay calls particular attention to those “fantasies of physical mastery and engineering know-how” that continue to drive so much science fiction as part and parcel of the way imperialism “facilitated the subjugation of less developed cultures, wove converging networks of technical administration, and established standards of ‘objective measurement’ that led inevitably to myths of racial and national supremacy.” @canavan_introduction_2015, 10 — quoting “Science Fiction and Empire,” in SF Studies 30.2 (July 2003)

Less faith in progress than one might otherwise think?  Reminds readers that the gains made by progress are fragile, and could be taken away at any moment.  "The penalty of our present civiliztion is that it makes us soft and without resistance.” From 192210_human_progress

But here, about as positivist as you can get, in 193107_wonders_machine_age: "Famines, pestilence and other scourges were the usual thing long before the Machine Age, when there was no machine to put the blame on. Today, thanks to the Machine Age, we no longer have country-wide famines of the severity of the past; and thanks to science, we no longer have the scourges and pestilences that our ancestors had to contend with. Quick communication by rail, water, and air, tends to do away with both acute famine and widespread diseases.”  States that “science fiction is based upon the progress of science; THAT IS ITS VERY FOUNDATION. Without it, there could be no science fiction.”  Faith in technological progress is synonymous with SF, for Gernsback.  Adds that if we go back to a Middle Age, the Machine Age will not be the cause of it.  Humans will

(from footnote)  Throughout *Radio for All,* Gernsback uses by then slightly older, outmoded technologies to open up radio's possible futures to a new community of wirelessly connected citizens.  Daniel Czitrom describes this approach to educating a new public in the very technology that would constitute their awareness of themselves *as* a public as Gernsback's "hardware socialism."

regulation & activism

-----------------------------

"However, the competition magazine, Electrician and Mechanic, soon adopted this idea and founded a club of radio amateurs named The Wireless Club.”  @tesla_reprint_2007

broadcast regulation

---------------------------

> *Activism, community organization, and manifestos written in service of radio amateur rights after the US government banned all public wireless activities in the wake of World War I; includes later writings for the Technocracy movement.*

With the outbreak of World War I, the U.S. Navy outlawed all amateur wireless broadcasting activities and took sole control of the airwaves.  *Modern Electrics* thus became a community forum for frustrations over this policy, as well as a drawing board for what broadcast regulation should look like once the war was over.  Gernsback and his associates formed "The Wireless Association of America" in 1910, an education and outreach organization that ended up training many of the wireless operators that the Navy would need once the U.S. entered the war, one of who even developed a means of recording clandestine German U-boat commands that were being relayed through a New Jersey wireless station, unbeknownst to the U.S. Government (**Sayville**).  As Gernsback liked to proudly claim later in life, language from his *Modern Electrics* editorial on broadcast regulation (**The Alexander Wireless Bill**) was eventually taken up by the Congress's Wireless Act of 1912.  Finally, as Tim Wu writes, *Radio News* later served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country's history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and "what one might expect to hear on them -- a forerunner of the once hugely profitable *TV Guide.*"^[@wu_master_2010, 39.]

Gernsback would later re-enter policy debates and the politics of technology with his short-lived *Technocracy Review,* which featured essays by the leaders of the Technocracy, Inc. movement.  People like Howard Scott argued that a small elite of technologically-inclined leaders, by dint of their mathematical and engineering expertise, would be able to govern the country more rationally, economically, and fairly.  Gernsback's editorials for this magazine provide an overview of the idea as it gained currency after the stock market crash ("The Machine and the Depression").

“Unquestionably the entire credit for obtaining the amateur’s rights belongs to *Modern Electrics*” (**Wireless and the Amateur: A Retrospect**, February 1913)

Maybe use footnotes on Technocracy and HG's ambiguous adoption of their ideas in 193107 Wonders of the Machine Age?

see Chapter 4 of "Autonomous Technology" by Langdon Winner; Evernote titled "Langdon Winner on technocracy"

There is of course a direct line to the gadget obsession of today, focusing only on devices and what they can do rather than who designed them and why, who gets to use them and how those uses differ.  But HG was *always* interested in how things worked, and sharing that knowledge with the world.  He believed that understanding technology meant making it from scratch, or at least taking it apart to understand how it worked.  So yes, sometimes socially blind, but his maker's ethos constituted a social imperative in its own right.

from intro to Kipling’s “Night Mail”:  “The benign anti-democratic rule of Kipling’s A.B.C. anticipate the direction of H.G. Wells and his followers in the 1930s.  The journal of the H.G. Wells society, Cosmopolis, advanced tha cuase of world unity then merged with The Plan, the journal for the Federation of Progressive Societies and Individuals.  The disparate groups on the left recognised the need to band together to resist the fascist agglomeration, an aggressive praxis that Wells described in a lecture as ‘liberal fascism.’  They stood for a planned economy, the rule of the intellectual, production for use rather than profit and resisistance to the racial myths and discredited eugenics of Hitler.  One clear distinction between liberal fascism and its Nazi enemy was that the airships of the progressive forces remained on the drawing board of the imagination.” (17)

Eric Drown sees HG as a modernist and a progressive:

	“Gernsback melded his own version of middle-class progressivism with a grass-roots liberal republican techno-utopianism he found among the amateur radio operators and home electrical experimenters to whom he sold apparatus, supplies, and a compelling view of the world.  As an immigrant bearing no professional credentials himself, Gernsback could not wear the mantle of progressive reform without making significant alterations in it.  First, while he believed in the usefulness of a formal technical education, he also gave considerable weight to innate talent and hard work.  Successful inventors like Thomas Edison and Lee de Forest were possessed of innate abilities that could not be taught in schools.  In such men talent combined with dedication to produce visionaries far superior to the products of universities, engineering schools, training programs, or correspondence courses.  …  progressive reform sought to integrate Americans with the new realities: corporate capitalism, mass culture, and expert government.  For Gernsback, these new realities were a mixed blessing.  He was an entrepreneur, competing increasingly with corporations, his business was impacted by government regulation, and in danger of being left behind by national broadcasting chains established through co-operation between the Department of Commerce, General Electric, Westinghouse, and AT&T.  As long as he credibly could, he insisted on the autonomy of the entrepreneur.  …  Promoting the notion that social progress would follow on the heels of the technological innovations produced by visionary men of genius, Gernsback’s electric futurism was a variation on progressive thought.  Still, Gernsback was offering technically-minded men an autonomy they would rarely if ever achieve.  He focused them on the glories of the entrepreneurial life even while machines put them out of work and raised the entrance costs to capitalist competition.  Though the future would belong not to the men Gernsback’s magazines tried to produce, but to the organizations that shaped them and American culture to organizational needs, his vision of the amateur inventor compensated readers with a vision of themselves as men capable of shaping their own future.”  (81-2, 84) 

These things Gernsback is reporting on must largely have been a matter of conjecture on little bits of information received and reported on by the newspapers.  Much of the negotiations between the FTC, RCA and AT&T were done behind closed doors.  “And all of this maneuvering that could have so altered American communications and culture transpired behind the scrim of corporate confidentiality, not to be made public until scholarly investigation decades later.”  (Wu 80)

In the confluence of engineering, technics, and the law, HG echoes the concerns of Lawrence Lessig in his argument that technology is replacing law in the digital age, that the newest technology makes the slower moving law obsolete, in 192610 v8n4, "The Broadcasting Situation": 

	“In the meanwhile radio broadcasting has not been ruined.  Far from it.  Radio has always been able to take care of itself, and will continue to do so in the future.  To be sure, we all want a radio law to straighten out some of our present tangles, but in the end radio engineering will make the best law obsolete.”

	again, in 192701 v8n7, "Radio Progresses," the argument that law moves slower than technology.  on telephone chaos in the early days, hearing many voices on the same call:  “However, it required no law to rectify this situation, and in a few years the telephone engineers had solved the problem satisfactorily.”
