"'phone and code":  Dynamophone, Radioson, and Other Emerging Media

================================================================

The early twentieth century is commonly seen as a transitional period in American invention, from a reliance on the work of independent, almost mythologically brilliant inventors to corporate-based industrial research laboratories.  For radio historian Hugh Aitken, the most meaningful development in the emergence of radio---the move from the spark gap to continuous wave transmission, which allowed the broadcasting of voice and audio rather than simple telegraphic code---happened at this "hazy boundary where radio stopped being a matter for visionary experimenters and started to become a hardheaded business capable of gaining and holding a commercial market."^[@aitken_continuous_1985, p. 9-10.]  But recent scholarship has explored the ways that the corporate model was both preceded by older forms of collaborative invention, as well as accommodated independent inventors who worked well into the twentieth century.  Historian of technology Eric S. Hintz argues that despite the commonly accepted story, independent inventors continued to be a source of viable ideas well after the "heroic" era of inventors like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell:

> . . . lesser-known "post-heroic" inventors continued to contribute many important innovations throughout the twentieth century, among them [Samuel] Ruben's mercury battery, Edwin Land's Polaroid film, and Chester Carlson's Xerox photocopying process. . . . There is certainly no denying the importance of science-based R&D at firms like GE, AT&T, and DuPont, but vertically integrated industrial research was not the only path to successful innovation.  Small and medium-sized firms often pursued innovation strategies---licensing independent inventors, hiring consultants, and outsourcing inventions---that were much different from the ones followed by bigger firms.^[@hintz_portable_2009, p. 26-7, 56.  See also @hintz_post-heroic_2011 for a chart showing that patents issued to independent inventors outnumbered corporate patents until 1933 and "still represented nearly 50 percent of total patents throughout the 1950s."]

Muddling the distinctiveness of this transition from the other side is Paul Israel, who shows that many of the developments in telegraph technology throughout the 19th century were the product of a machine shop style of collaborative problem solving "in which skilled operatives, superintendents, machinists, and manufacturers make up technological communities that draw on practical experience to design, build, and refine new technology."^[@israel_machine_1992, p. 2.]  In this shop culture,

> few inventors actually worked alone and none worked in complete isolation.  Conceptualization was often stimulated by access to new information.  And the construction, testing, and redesigning of apparatus necessary for practical application almost invariably required an inventor to seek the assistance of others, whose own contributions often altered the original design.^[@israel_machine_1992, p. 57.]

Much like the wrinkles and questions shared by wireless amateurs in the Gernsback magazines, these nineteenth-century craftsmen communicated through trade journals like *The Telegrapher: A Journal of Electrical Progress* (1864-1877).  Indeed, the communities making use of Gernsback's magazines, perhaps in spite of the rhetoric they contained, are yet further evidence of collaborative development forming a continuous tradition from the mid-nineteenth century on, calling into question whether there ever was anything like the mythological, lone inventor.

Falling somewhere in the middle of this collaborative versus individualistic divide, Gernsback framed his writings on the development of new devices in terms of amateurism.  A recurring argument in his editorials throughout the 1920s had it that the next great innovations, like television, would come not from corporate laboratories, but from the avant garde of enterprising amateurs who could afford to take risks and try out wacky ideas (**Why the Radio Set Builder**).  But these amateurs were up against an establishment that was rapidly consolidating its power.  After the federal government took control of the airwaves during World War I and assumed ownership of all wireless patents in order to aid the war effort, RCA was formed as a partnership between the government, General Electric and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America in order to continue advancing radio technology in the interests of national security (**Silencing America's Wireless; Radio Enters a New Phase**).^[@wenaas_radiola:_2007, p. 29.]  "As a result," Andrew Ross writes, "the explosive age of industrial invention lay in the past, viewed as much too volatile in its effects for the scientifically regulated process of production favored by monopoly capitalism.  The new emphasis on control, precision, uniformity, predictability, and standardization meant the extinction of the entrepreneur-inventor."^[@ross_strange_1991, p. 124.]  Radio amateurs could feel the effects immediately, with the number of radio parts dealers in the US (as opposed to consumer-ready, complete radio set retailers) falling from an estimated 30,000 in 1922 to 2,500 in 1926.^[@massie_hugo_2002.]  At the same time, the coming of continuous wave transmission and vacuum tube sets meant not only that radio was becoming increasingly complex for the average amateur, but exploding in popularity among an American public who could comfortably listen in to nightly broadcasts.  Seemingly overnight, radio was firmly cemented in American life as an everyday piece of household furniture.  Not only were radios rapidly spreading into homes across the country after the so-called "radio Christmas" of 1924, but the legislative frameworks that would determine the structure of American broadcasting were finally being hammered out.^["More than ten times the number of tube sets were manufactured in 1925 than just two years earlier, and four times as many speakers as in 1923."  @douglas_listening_1999, 78.]  No longer was wireless the province of technically savvy experimenters chatting about whatever came to mind, it was big entertainment.

Given this situation, it was an interesting time for a new magazine to emerge as the voice of radio amateurism.  While *Electrical Experimenter* had begun as a specialized companion magazine for tinkerers, by 1918 it owed its 100,000 issue per month circulation to an increasingly general focus.  A magazine whose tagline was "The Electrical Magazine for the Experimenter" became "The Electrical Magazine for Everybody."  It later changed its name to *Science and Invention* in 1920 and began covering a much wider array of developments across the sciences.  In order to maintain a relationship with his original readership of experimenters, Gernsback launched a new title, *Radio Amateur News* (later shortened to *Radio News*) in 1919.  *Radio News* became the new home for hands-on readers, a magazine that took seriously the role of the independent experimenter throughout the 1920s, when, in Gernsback's words, "In all of the laboratories of our large industrial companies, research scientists are busy, day and night, in inventing and perfecting new devices."^[@gernsback_garrett_1928.]

In a 1923 editorial for *Radio News,* Gernsback touches on the anxieties among his readership about the role of the amateur in a world of increasingly professionalized engineering and invention.  Explicitly issuing a challenge to this group, he argues that the amateur is nothing if he isn't seen and valued by the public.

> Of what real use is the amateur of today?  What does he really do to make the world a better place to live in?  Of what use is he to the community at large?  If the amateur will ask himself these questions, and search his heart, he will come to the conclusion that, indeed, his utility is microscopic. . . . *As far as the public is concerned, the radio amateur does not even exist.* (**Who Will Save the Radio Amateur**)

The response from a passionate readership was swift.  "The amateur's work is valuable," argues one reader with the conviction that tinkering is not play but important "work."  Another recommends the approach of a "public-minded amateur," who hosts concerts, relays news, weather, and other useful information for free to small neighborhood gatherings.  Still another suggests forming an Amateur Radio Research League whose sharing of expertise and ideas in "miniature laboratories" might be able to compete with the large corporations.  I have seen many different editions of these magazines in various university and personal archives, and it is clear from the many issues containing underlines and annotations, scribbles in the margins from readers working out measurements, and relevant newspaper clippings attached to the pages, that this was a highly active readership.  Some readers couldn't afford the components detailed in the experiments and diagrams published in *Radio News.*  But as one writes in a letter to the editor, "You can better realize what these magazines mean to me when I say that I seldom, if ever, get a chance to have the material to experiment with, so I must content myself with reading matter, and I do like to read, especially such a wealth of material as is combined in the pages of your three publications."^[@stephens_opinion_1925.]  These readers counted themselves as experimenters simply by reading the magazines.

Though Gernsback's collaborators and readers in many ways felt left out of the broadcast boom, *Radio News* remained a beacon for tinkerers around the world who knew that their homebrewed sets were far superior to the average RCA or Westinghouse radios sold in department stores.  Gernsback argued that it was the amateurs forming the true vanguard in the advance of the radio "science."

> The set builder naturally is well able to compete with the manufacturer, for two reasons. First, his time costs him little, and in price, therefore, he can compete easily with the factory-made set. Secondly, he has the jump on the manufactured set for the simple reason that, as like as not, his circuit is the latest out, and, therefore, will have improvements that the manufactured set can not boast for some months to come.  (**Radio Enters a New Phase**)

One incredibly fruitful area of experimentation for the amateurs focused on the short wave portion of the radio spectrum, which was initially deemed useless by government regulators and commercial operators.  Amateurs discovered in the early 1920s that short waves were easily reflected off the ionosphere, and could travel great distances around the globe with small antennas and very little power (**The Short-Wave Era**).  Gernsback started an entirely new magazine devoted to this field in 1930, *Short Wave Craft.*^[The evolution of titles for *Short Wave Craft* reflects a history of technologies in which "craft" was seen to be applicable.  It became *Short Wave and Television* in 1937, *Radio and Television* in 1938, and was finally folded into *Radio Craft* in 1941.]  As the previously speculative dreams of television came closer to fruition, Gernsback founded *Television News* in 1931.  In his first editorial for this magazine, he emphasized that large corporations---who by necessity had to be depended on to produce these incredibly complex and expensive prototypes---were actually stifling competition by "jealously guarding whatever improvements are made, because these large firms naturally wish to come out with a complete set that can be sold ready-made to the public."  Continuing his argument that communities of amateur tinkerers who openly shared their results were a necessary element in the development of new media, Gernsback adds:

> Everyone knows that, the more people who are working on an art, the more rapid the progress will be in the end.  Many improvements in radio have been due to experimenters who started in a small way and, later on, became outstanding figures in radio. . . . The more experimenters and the more television fans who become interested in the art, the quicker it will advance and the sooner it will be put on the stable basis which it deserves.

Unlike *Modern Electrics* or *Electrical Experimenter,* *Television News* attempted to serve as the voice of a community of amateur experimenters that had not yet come into being:  "To this purpose I am dedicating this new publication, and the future will demonstrate the correctness of the assumption."^[@gernsback_television_1931.]  The idea that amateurs would eventually offer the world some of the most important contributions to the development of television was perhaps one of Gernsback's most far-flung science fictions, with many articles having simply to begin with a definition of what, precisely, television even was.  One of Gernsback's articles slightly lifts Edison's now famous patent language for the phonograph, in saying that "television does for the eye what the telephone does for the ear."[^tvqt]

[^tvqt]: For a reading of Edison's speculative description of cinema before the fact, see @gunning_doing_2001.  Gernsback's entire definition reads:  "To the layman who does not as yet know what television is, I may say that the term describes an electrical process, whereby it is possible to see at a distance and to view distant events as they are taking place.  In this way television does for the eye what the telephone does for the ear.  Your friend, using the telephone, talks to you from his office, while you are sitting in yours; while the television process is comparable in that you will see your friend as he is talking to you, and, vice versa, he will see you."  @gernsback_television_1927.

But the unfounded optimism of the idea that amateur experimenters were the engine of emerging media became clear by the end of the decade.  *Radio News* announced in January 1929 that it would end its monthly "constructional prize contest" due to a lack of quality submissions.  In the initial announcement to the contest, Gernsback reminded readers that their ideas must be experimentally demonstrated:  "It is not the idea, *but the putting of it into execution,* that makes a man an inventor.  In addition to this, most purely theoretical ideas are impracticable."^[@_radio_1928.]  It seems that with the complexities of consumer radio by 1929, too few amateurs were capable of realizing their ideas in any material way:

> The rules of the contest stated very plainly that no one would be eligible for a prize unless some experimental work had been done and the practicability of the device had been demonstrated by the builder.  Most of the entries consisted merely of ideas or suggestions, accompanied by the request that *Radio News* do the experimental work necessary for their full development.^[@_end_1929.]

Perhaps sensing this problem, Gernsback had already begun focusing on older technologies in recommendations for what to build.  During a period of such rapid change in radio manufacture, new applications of older technologies was a form of dissent for tinkerers.  Designs for cheaply-made, easy to reproduce components like **The Radioson Detector** could rival the newer, industrially produced vacuum tube sets in that they were cheaper, easier to fix, and most importantly, easily understood by most home experimenters.  In a move that is perhaps unexpected for a technofuturist like Gernsback, he even begins to temper what he saw as a boosterish fervor over the rapid developments in radio.  Despite this seemingly overnight explosion, Gernsback writes in 1927, “there have not been any revolutionary improvements in radio and it is likely there will not be any."  Instead, people should expect a long process of gradual refinement:

> It is this process of slow evolution that we may expect in the future, as well, and the old adage also holds true in radio: "Natura non facit saltum"---which, translated, says that Nature does not make jumps.  In other words, all developments are part of a slow-moving plan of evolution.  Even revolutionary inventions, when they do come along, will be found in the end to be not half as great a departure as they were thought to be at first.^[@gernsback_coming_1926.]

Taking the longer view allowed Gernsback to read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of emerging media.  In many of his editorials, the history of media is evoked not merely as a nostalgic trip back to the devices of yesteryear, but as an archive of possibilities ripe for future experimentation.  For instance, in another 1927 editorial, at a moment in which music and variety programs were flooding the country, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people's minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology.  Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying wireless telegraphy became "radio," a presence in virtually everyone's daily life, Gernsback writes, "the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy. . . .  There is hardly any industry today that cannot make use of radio instruments in some phase of its work."^[@gernsback_radio_1927.]  His examples range from a force-field burglar alarm to automating the recording of lightning strikes, from measuring the minute weight of a fly to scanning factory workers for stolen metals.  This wasn't merely a historiographical move, to remind us that the inherent features of wireless---information transmitted through the air---have now been scattered by the winds of media evolution in a way that influences countless other devices.  In articles like **New Radio 'Things' Wanted,** Gernsback encouraged amateurs to remix and retrofit old technologies in order to imagine what the next great advance in radio might look like.  Pieces like this both educated an increasingly interested public on precisely how this technology worked, as well as sought out new paths forward that may have been overlooked.

One of the examples of media historical curiosities listed by Gernsback in this editorial is **The Dynamophone,** his own invention from 1908.  First published as a set of instructions in *Modern Electrics,* the Dynamophone setup involved a telephone mouthpiece connected to the transmitting end of a Telimco and an engine to the receiving end, so that the "power" of the human voice could be used to start that engine.  "While it was at that time but a toy," Gernsback wrote in the 1927 retrospective, "the apparatus foreshadowed broadcasting, because this was before the days of the wireless telephone, and the human voice actually did create effects at the receiving end."  This was a clever workaround:  at a time when the voice couldn't be *transmitted* via wireless, perhaps it could at least be *translated* into a form of electrical or mechanical force.  Just like the affective voice of a news bulletin or an operatic tenor transmitted over the airwaves in the late 1920s, the 1908 Dynamophone used the power of the human voice to "create effects."  While Reginald Fessenden had already produced an elegant solution to the technical problem of using radio waves to produce frequencies in the audible range with his discovery of the heterodyne principle, in which two electrical waves of different frequencies can amplify one another, Gernsback's Dynamophone was a kind of metaphorical resolution to the same problem.^[For a discussion of heterodyning, see the annotations in **The Dynamophone.**]  It was a trickster solution to one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the history of radio.  Gernsback, like many of the amateurs he represented, is perhaps best understood not as an "inventor," but a tinkerer whose idiosyncratic know-how lent his creations a quirkiness, a sense of humor.

Gernsback's own activities as a tinkerer were conducted alongside his publishing endeavors, beginning with the Electro Importing Company's main factory and office building at 233 Fulton Street, now on the site of Ground Zero, in the *Modern Electrics* days.  Alongside Coggeshall, Harry Winfield Secor, and his brother Sidney Gernsback, Hugo manufactured not only traditional electrical equipment like telephone parts and headphones, but far more speculative devices.^[@_e._1915]  The magazines often read like lab reports detailing the progress made in these experiments in a way that opened them up to suggestions from the community, and the operative principle behind new devices like were demonstrated through experiments that could be easily reproduced at home.  **The Physiophone** introduced a means of transforming the music from a phonograph record into rhythmic pulses that could allow people with hearing impairments to enjoy music.  Other, more farfetched creations like **The Isolator,** an oxygen-filled, soundproof helmet that aided concentration, were interspersed with the more serious proposals.

Experimentation continued when Gernsback founded WRNY in 1925, a medium-range broadcast station operating out of New York that was used to debut new broadcast media and analyze the effects of various instruments and signal processing techniques on the auditory perception of the station's listeners.  Several articles cover these experiments, including a live radio concert broadcast that included one of the earliest electronic keyboards in history, developed at the successor to the E.I. Company, Radio News Laboratories.  **The Pianorad** looked like an automobile engine with a horn attached to the end, covered in radio tubes that looked like engine cylinders, with each tube controlling a single note on the keyboard.  WRNY is also notable for conducting one of the earliest regular television broadcasts on record, using a unique method of interleaving audio and visual signals across a single frequency (**Television and the Telephot**).^[The *New York Times* printed an announcement that WRNY would begin regular television broadcasts.  During an otherwise regular radio broadcast, the image of the performer's face was sent out periodically throughout the program.  @_wrny_1928.]  While conducting these groundbreaking experiments, Gernsback kept developments at WRNY open to the contributions and participation of his readers.  Regardless of how advanced the devices seemed---solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes---his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.[^2b9d]

[^2b9d]: WRNY was short-lived.  In 1927, under the guidance of then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the newly formed Federal Radio Commission included WRNY in its list of 164 smaller-scale stations who had to justify their existence or be forced to shut down.  Tim Wu:  “In effecting its program of clearing the airwaves, the agency relied on a new distinction between so-called general public service stations and propaganda stations.  These were, in effect, synonyms for ‘large’ and ‘small’ respectively, but it was apparently easier to assault the underdog if one could label him a propagandist, even though the term’s present pejorative sense would not take hold until used to describe communications in Nazi Germany.  In any case, by whatever name, the FRC favored the large, networked stations affiliated with NBC (and later CBS).  Because the large operators had superior equipment, and fuller and more varied schedules, the FRC could claim not implausibly that they better served the public.”  @wu_master_2010, p. 83.]

While Gernsback always opened up the work done in his labs and later at WRNY to the public, he often does so in describing a finished device that would be offered for sale in subsequent issues of the same magazine.  This often makes the mode of address confusing, as it is in **The Radioson Detector.**  What begins as an objective description of a new wireless component seems eventually to boil down to a product pitch.  Indeed, the Radioson would be advertised for sale from the Electro Importing Company in competitor publications in the coming months.  But the level of detail Gernsback goes into here is unique, making this essay not just a product announcement, but a detailed discussion of how the device is constructed and the decisions that went into its design.  This is surprising, especially given that the intense commercial competition to improve on detector technology "meant that there often was a great deal of secrecy about technical details."^[@thackeray_when_1983.]  One wonders then who Gernsback is pitching this device to, and why.  If the Radioson is such a valuable advance in radio technology, why would he share the detailed blueprints for his design for the cost of a magazine issue?  

I think these pieces and others like them are best considered as a proof of concept for a growing group of "electrics" hobbyists.  The Telimco, for instance, was not exactly the revolutionary device that first brought radio to the masses Gernsback later liked to claim it was.  Though its advertisements claimed the set was "guaranteed to work up to one mile," the Telimco was notoriously finicky.^[@_wireless_1905]  As it was sold, the outfit had a range of merely 300-500 feet and could only receive signals from further distances when a large antenna was hooked up.  Further, it was highly susceptible to any kind of electrical interference, such as the elevator motor in the Electro Importing Company building, which caused difficulties during in-store demonstrations of the apparatus.  The Telimco's untuned circuits, which would produce a high degree of interference for any nearby radio station, would soon be outlawed by federal legislation.  For these reasons, its metal filings coherers "had all but disappeared from commercial work in 1910" according to historian of early radio Thomas White.^[@white_pioneering_1996]  From this perspective, the Telimco seems less a practical means of communication than the promise of its future iterations.

So while in essence, the Telimco was little more than a gimmick, a parlor trick---press a button and a bell in another room would ring without the need for any intervening wires---it was also a rough prototype, an aggregate of handmade components that encouraged and enabled a conversation on what the wireless medium may look like in the future.  The technical limitations of the device as it then stood didn't stop Gernsback from describing how thousands of perfectly synchronized home wireless sets would be capable of sending a message to the aliens that surely must be listening for us on Mars (**Signaling to Mars**).  Or months later, laying out in great technical detail how it would be possible to send and receive motion pictures over the airwaves using currently available equipment (**Television and the Telephot**).  The Radioson and the Telimco were two of countless artifacts profiled in the Gernsback magazines that blurred the lines between the real and the imaginary.  While some were awarded patents and others were available for sale, others seem more like branding exercises or rallying calls for a community of active amateur experimenters to run with the as-of-yet unrealizable idea.  More often than not, these above categories bleed into one another.  Above all, Gernsback thought that the best way for new ideas travel was to make them public, and allow others to "fork" or "version" his hardware so that the idea could grow faster.  While the work of these amateur experimenters in the aggregate may not have been technically responsible for ushering in the futures Gernsback loved to claim he had predicted, they formed a collective endeavor to find the material means of realizing ideas that were still, as of yet, physically impossible.
