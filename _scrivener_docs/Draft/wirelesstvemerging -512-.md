radio and the amateur avant garde

--------------------------------------------

What role did this community play?

A detente throughout the 1910s after the Radio Act is passed, wherein amateurs could still be seen as the avant garde.

Though HG and collaborators feel left out of the broadcast boom, Radio News is still a beacon for tinkerers around the world, who feel that their sets are far superior to the "average" sets sold by companies, in department stores, etc., and that they serve as the vanguard of advancing the "science."

The amateur avant garde:  

> The set builder naturally is well able to compete with the manufacturer, for two reasons. First, his time costs him little, and in price, therefore, he can compete easily with the factory-made set. Secondly, he has the jump on the manufactured set for the simple reason that, as like as not, his circuit is the latest out, and, therefore, will have improvements that the manufactured set can not boast for some months to come.  (**Radio Enters a New Phase**)

But later, when the technology and the regulation of radio becomes too complicated for amateurs to follow, when WRNY is forced to shut down by the FCC because it's too small, we see a different track being taken, an archaeology of forgotten developments that are simpler, and can still prove useful.

These contradictions [extolling the virtues of the amateur and the tinkerer while being bankrolled by RCA and AT&T(?) advertising revenue] abounded in the pages of Gernsback’s publications.  

1925 Sept -- "General Harbord Explains the Patent Situation" 252+ president of RCA.  192509

The May 1920 issue (v8n1) described C.D. Wagoner, “The New Radio Corporation,” on the formation of RCA, and two years later, their ads were being run in HG publications:  “[RCA ad]” p. 877.  Science and Invention Jan 1922, v9n9  RCA ads in a Gernsback mag as early as Jan 1922.  “Listening to Broadcasted News and Music from the Radio Telephone.”  In bed with their money early on.  

From **Radio Enters Into a New Phase,** HG defends patents as a monopoly:  RCA holds a patent on virtually every important radio related invention.  Gernsback argues that every patent is a monopoly.  Any small set manufacturer has to pay expensive royalties, phasing out all but the largest firms.  G is strangely optimistic about this possibility:  “What has been predicted for a number of years has thus come to pass.  The radio set business will be in the hands of a few strong corporations, which will control the legitimate set business in the United States on a highly competitive basis.  All other reports to the contrary, this certainly is not a general monopoly of the set business; and we believe that, in time to come, it will work out to the advantage of the public.”  But set manufacturers are slower to change than the experimenter.

As Tim Wu argues, Radio News even served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country’s history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and “what one might expect to hear on them—a forerunner of the once hugely profitable TV Guide” (39)  What these lists reveal is that much of the chatter on the air as early as 1922 came from corporate sources:  “many early stations were run by radio manufacturers such as Westinghouse, the pioneer of the ready-to-plug-in model [a claim Gernsback would certainly dispute], and RCA, both of which had an obvious interest in promoting the medium.  Still many stations were run by amateurs, ‘radio clubs,’ universities, churches, hotels, poultry farms, newspapers, the U.S. Army and Navy” (39).

The example of the lists (apparently published many times in Radio News?) cited by Wu is Armstrong Perry, “What Anyone Can Hear: Complete List of Broadcasting Stations in U.S.”  March 1922, 814.

“[RCA ad]” p. 877.  Science and Invention Jan 1922, v9n9  RCA ads in a Gernsback mag as early as Jan 1922.  “Listening to Broadcasted News and Music from the Radio Telephone.”  In bed with their money early on.

G., “The Garrett Inventor” v15n11, 192803 — “It was pointed out, in all sincerity, that no great inventions could possibly come from the small inventor in the future.” …  “The story sounded plausible enough, because in all of the laboratories of our large industrial companies, research scientists are busy, day and night, in inventing and perfecting new devices.”  Gives examples of how this is not the case. 

Andrew Ross:  “Industrial corporations either controlled or purchased most invention patents, hoarding them in order to suppress competition, while independent inventors lacked the big capital that was increasingly required for research and development of their alternative technologies.  As a result, the explosive age of industrial invention lay in the past, viewed as much too volatile in its effects for the scientifically regulated process of production favored by monopoly capitalism.  The new emphasis on control, precision, uniformity, predictability, and standardization meant the extinction of the entrepreneur-inventor, whose heyday had included the likes of George Westinghouse, Francis Richards, Edward Weston, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Lee De Forest, Elihu Thomson, Charles Brush, Charles Hall, Edward Dean Acheson, and Elmer Sperry.  While scientists became increasingly ‘proletarianized,’ the new Fordist compromise meant that monopoly cartels, often in agreement with labor unions, would seek new uses for old technology rather than risking the potential instability offered by new labor-saving, and ecologically sound, technologies.” (124)

television and community experimentation

-------------------------------------------------------

definitely use, then delete or rephrase from 193107 Television Technique:

[^rqrn]: Gernsback's first editorial for this magazine emphasized a slightly different point: that the large corporations---who by necessity had to be depended on to produce these incredibly complex and expensive technologies---were actually stifling competition by "jealously guarding whatever improvements are made, because these large firms naturally wish to come out with a complete set that can be sold ready-made to the public."  Continuing his argument that communities of amateur tinkerers, openly sharing their results, were a necessary element in the development of new media, Gernsback continues:

> Everyone knows that, the more people who are working on an art, the more rapid the progress will be in the end.  Many improvements in radio have been due to experimenters who started in a small way and, later on, became outstanding figures in radio. … The more experimenters and the more television fans who become interested in the art, the quicker it will advance and the sooner it will be put on the stable basis which it deserves.

He saw *Television News* as providing an entry point for this community of amateur television experimenters that had yet to come into being:  "To this purpose I am dedicating this new publication, and the future will demonstrate the correctness of the assumption."^[@gernsback_television_1931.]

Mixing up sensory inputs: television signals become tacticle and auditory sensation.  Media are synonymous with the mechanical transportation and simulation of sensory inputs.

“An interesting phenomenon in connection with television itself is that, if the output currents of the light-sensitive cell are listened to in a telephone receiver, they can be heard as sounds, and every object or scene has its own peculiar characteristic sound.  For example, the fingers of a hand held in front of the transmitter will give rise to a sound similar to the grating of a very coarse file, while the human face will cause a high-pitched whistle which will vary in pitch as the head is turned or even when the features are moved.  For experimental purposes Mr. Baird had some phonograph records made of the sounds made by different persons’ faces, and by listening carefully to the reproductions of these records it is possible to distinguish between one face and another by the sounds they make!  With practice, faces may even be recognized by the sounds produced.”^[@dinsdale_television_1927]

lifting from Edison patent language on cinema/phonograph:  “To the layman who does not as yet know what television is, I may say that the term describes an electrical process, whereby it is possible to see at a distance and to view distant events as they are taking place.  In this way television does for the eye what the telephone does for the ear.  Your friend, using the telephone, talks to you from his office, while you are sitting in yours; while the television process is comparable in that you will see your friend as he is talking to you, and, vice versa, he will see you.”^[@gernsback_television_1927]

were these actually important inventions?

-----------------------------------------------------

> Written and published largely by middle-class professionals and para-professionals, and read mainly – although not exclusively – by young men about to become wage earners, American pulp SF is best understood as an inter-class discussion about the real life consequences of the institutionalization (in corporate research laboratories, university science departments and government bureaucracies) and professionalization of American science and invention, as well as the ‘scientific’ routinization this brought into industrial work."^[@drown_finer_2006, 92]

> In view of his own failures and successes, Gernsback told readers that professional scientists were often too timid, conventional and incredulous to recognize uncredentialed genius when they saw it.  Unfettered by the disciplinarianism of the professional environment and endowed with fresh imaginations, amateur scientists were the true inheritors of the scientific spirit, he argued. In short, even though science and invention had been professionalized and institutionalized for two decades already, amateur science was the real science; holding excellent prospects for financial reward and even opportunities for fame.^[@drown_finer_2006.]

They didn't have scientific theory, but embedded know-how.

gernsback's own inventions

-------------------------------------

![](images/eico_labs1.png)

![From left to right, Harry Winfield Secor and Sidney Gernsback, Hugo's brother.  Both images from *Electrical Experimenter,* January 1915.](images/eico_labs2.png)

Gernsback's own tinkering was conducted with his staff alongside their magazine publishing activities, beginning with the Electro Importing Company's main factory and office building at 233 Fulton Street, now on the site of Ground Zero.  Alongside Coggeshall, Harry Winfield Secor, and his brother Sidney Gernsback, Hugo manufactured not only traditional electrical equipment like telephone parts and headphones, but more speculative devices.^[@_e._1915]  The magazines often read like lab reports, detailing the progress made in these experiments in a way that opened them up to suggestions from the community.  The range and nature of the "inventions" detailed in the magazine is diverse.  The operative principle behind new devices like the Osophone were demonstrated through experiments that could be reproduced at home (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**).  **The Physiophone** introduced a means of transforming the music from a phonograph record into rhythmic pulses that could allow people with hearing impairments to enjoy music.  More farfetched devices like **The Isolator,** an oxygen-filled, soundproof helmet that aided concentration, were interspersed with the more serious proposals.

Experimentation continued when Gernsback founded WRNY, a medium-range broadcast station operating out of New York that was used to debut new broadcast media and analyze the effects of various instruments and signal processing techniques on the auditory perception of the station's listeners.  Several articles and editorials cover these experiments, including a live radio concert broadcast that included one of the earliest electronic keyboards in history.  **The Pianorad** looked like an automobile engine with a horn attached to the end, covered in radio tubes that looked like engine cylinders, with each tube controlling a single note on the keyboard.  The instrument was developed at the successor to E.I. Company, Radio News Laboratories.  WRNY is also notable for conducting one of the earliest regular television broadcasts on record, using a unique method of interleaving audio and visual signals across a single frequency (**Television and the Telephot**).^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, p. 238, quotes a *New York Times* announcement of WRNY beginning reluar television broadcasts.  During an otherwise regular radio broadcast, the image of the performer's face was sent out periodically throughout the program.]  While conducting these groundbreaking experiments, Gernsback kept developments at WRNY open to the contributions and participation of his readers.  In one editorial for *Radio News*, Gernsback describes the television as just a simple add-on or expansion kit to a normal domestic radio set:  "I am quite certain that the final television apparatus on your radio set will take up no more room than your present cone speaker."^[@gernsback_television_1927.]  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of Gernsback's magazines seemed---solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes---his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.[^2b9d]

[^2b9d]: WRNY was short-lived.  In 1927, under the guidance of then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the newly formed Federal Radio Commission included WRNY in its list of 164 smaller-scale stations who had to justify their existence or be forced to shut down.  Tim Wu:  “In effecting its program of clearing the airwaves, the agency relied on a new distinction between so-called general public service stations and propaganda stations.  These were, in effect, synonyms for ‘large’ and ‘small’ respectively, but it was apparently easier to assault the underdog if one could label him a propagandist, even though the term’s present pejorative sense would not take hold until used to describe communications in Nazi Germany.  In any case, by whatever name, the FRC favored the large, networked stations affiliated with NBC (and later CBS).  Because the large operators had superior equipment, and fuller and more varied schedules, the FRC could claim not implausibly that they better served the public.”  @wu_master_2010, p. 83.]

While Gernsback always opened up the work done in his labs and later at WRNY to the public, he often does so in describing a finished device that would be offered for sale in subsequent issues of the same magazine.  This often makes the mode of address confusing, as it is in **The Radioson Detector.**  What begins as an objective description of a new wireless component seems eventually to boil down to a product pitch.  Indeed, the Radioson would be advertised for sale from the Electro Importing Company in competitor's publications in the coming months.  But the level of detail Gernsback goes into here is unique, making this essay not just a product announcement, but a detailed discussion of how the device is constructed and the descisions that went into its design.  This is surprising, especially given that the intense commercial competition to improve on detector technology "meant that there often was a great deal of secrecy about technical details."^[@thackeray_when_1983.]  One wonders then who Gernsback is pitching this device to, and why.  If the Radioson is such a valuable advance in radio technology, why would he share the detailed blueprints for his design for the cost of a magazine issue?  

I think these pieces and others like them are best considered as a proof of concept for a growing group of "electrics" hobbyists.  The Telimco, for instance, was not exactly the revolutionary device that first brought radio to the masses Gernsback later liked to claim it was.  Though its advertisements claimed the set was "guaranteed to work up to one mile," the Telimco was notoriously finicky.^[@_wireless_1905]  As it was sold, the outfit had a range of merely 300-500 feet and could only receive signals from further distances when a large antenna was hooked up.  Further, it was highly susceptible to any kind of electrical interference, such as the elevator motor in the Electro Importing Company building, which caused difficulties during in-store demonstrations of the apparatus.  The Telimco's untuned circuits, which would produce a high degree of interference for any nearby radio station, would soon be outlawed by federal legislation.  For these reasons, its metal filings coherers "had all but disappeared from commercial work in 1910" according to historian of early radio Thomas White.^[@white_pioneering_1996]  From this perspective, the Telimco seems less a practical means of communication than the promise of its future iterations.  A similar tone can be found in profiles of other Gernsback inventions, like **The Physiophone:**  writings that begin with seemingly dry engineering specifications don't take long to spin out into wondrous possibilities, futures that seem to proceed organically from the most minuscule of details.

So while in essence, the Telimco was little more than a gimmick, a parlor trick---press a button and a bell in another room would ring without the need for any intervening wires---it was also a rough prototype, an aggregate of handmade compontents that encouraged and enabled a conversation on what the wireless medium may look like in the future.  The technical limitations of the device as it then stood didn't stop Gernsback from publishing instructions in 1908 on connecting a telephone mouthpiece to the transmitting end of the Telimco and an engine to the receiving end, so that the "power" of the human voice could be used to start that engine (**The Dynamophone**).  Or in the following year, describing how thousands of perfectly synchronized home wireless sets would be capable of sending a message to the aliens that surely must be listening for us on Mars (**Signaling to Mars**).  Or months later, laying out in great technical detail how it would be possible to send and receive motion pictures over the airwaves using currently available equipment (**Television and the Telephot**).  The Radison and the Telimco were two of countless artifacts profiled in the Gernsback magazines that blurred the lines between the real and the imaginary.  While some were awarded patents and others were available for sale, others seem more like branding exercises or rallying calls for a community of active amateur experimenters to run with the as-of-yet unrealizable idea.  More often than not, these above categories bleed into one another.  Above all, Gernsback thought that the best way for new ideas travel was to make them public, and allow others to "fork" or "version" his hardware so that the idea could grow faster.

(use at all? so contrary to other elements in the intro…  maybe use in next, contribs to radio history section)

In a move that is perhaps unexpected for a technofuturist like Gernsback, he frequently tempers what he saw as a boosterish fervor over the rapid development of new technologies.  By 1927, radio was firmly cemented in American life as an everyday piece of household furniture.  Not only were radios rapidly spreading into homes across the country after the so-called "radio Christmas" of 1924, but the legislative frameworks that would determine the structure of American broadcasting were finally being hammered out.^["More than ten times the number of tube sets were manufactured in 1925 than just two years earlier, and four times as many speakers as in 1923."  @douglas_listening_1999, 78].  Despite this seemingly overnight explosion, Gernsback writes in 1927, “there have not been any revolutionary improvements in radio and it is likely there will not be any."  Instead, people should expect a long process of gradual refinement:

> It is this process of slow evolution that we may expect in the future, as well, and the old adage also holds true in radio: "Natura non facit saltum"---which, translated, says that Nature does not make jumps.  In other words, all developments are part of a slow-moving plan of evolution.  Even revolutionary inventions, when they do come along, will be found in the end to be not half as great a departure as they were thought to be at first.^[@gernsback_coming_1926.]

What Gernsback could do, however, was read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of emerging media.  In many of his editorials, the history of media is evoked not merely as a nostalgic trip back to the devices of yesteryear, but as an archive of possibilities ripe for future experimentation. For instance, in another 1927 editorial, at a moment when national broadcast networks were flickering to life and music and variety programs were flooding the country, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people's minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology. Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying wireless telegraphy became "radio," an everyday part of household furniture, Gernsback writes, "the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy. . . .  There is hardly any industry today that cannot make use of radio instruments in some phase of its work."^[@gernsback_radio_1927.]  His examples range from a force-field like burglar alarm, to automating the recording of lightning strikes, from measuring the minute weight and touch of a fly to scanning factory workers for stolen metals.  And, in a forgotten example of Gernsback's own from the 1900s (which he christened **The Dynamophone**) electric motors can be started remotely by the human voice, proving that "the apparatus foreshadowed broadcasting: the human voice actually did create effects at the receiving end," both for machines and humans.  Gernsback consistently reminds us that the inherent abilities of wireless, of information transmitted through the air, has now itself been scattered by the winds of technological evolution and inflects our understanding of and interaction with a fantastic number of techniques, technologies, and media.  This wasn't just a historiographical move.  In articles like **New Radio 'Things' Wanted,** Gernsback encouraged home experimenters to remix and retrofit old technologies in order to imagine what the next great advance in radio might look like.  Pieces like this both educated an expanding public on precisely how this technology worked, as well as sought out new paths forward that may have been overlooked.
