[television and other emerging media]

=================================

Can combine categories of TV and "media" here, because TV never really developed as a community for Gernsback.  He started *Television News* as a wager to the argument that communities of amateurs can advance a "new art" faster than any closed off, patent-hoarding corporation.  That may be true, but the corporations dictated the terms of that development.  So, this section can be more broadly about Gernsback's understanding of media history, and how new media develop within communities.

"the heartbeats of a chicken" can be amplifed to an auditorium…  Use bits on "Radio Steps Out," 192704, which has been removed from the book.

SF or 90s media theory?

--------------------------------

A number of quotes in the intro. And play a game: science fiction or 90s media theory? Can you tell which is part of which genre?

## Media history

> *Later works that read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of radio and television.*

In Gernsback's editorials, media history is evoked not merely as a nostalgic trip back to the devices of yesteryear, as it often is today in retro-kitsch, but as an archive of possibilities ripe for future experimentation. For instance, in a 1927 editorial ("Radio Steps Out"), at a moment when national broadcast networks were flickering to life and music and variety programs were flooding the country, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people's minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology. Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying wireless telegraphy became "radio," an everyday part of household furniture, Gernsback writes, "the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy. … There is hardly any industry today that cannot make use of radio instruments in some phase of its work."

His examples range from a force-field like burglar alarm, to automating the recording of lightning strikes, from measuring the minute weight and touch of a fly to scanning factory workers for stolen metals. And, in a forgotten example of Gernsback's own from the 1900s (which he christened the "Dynamophone") electric motors can be started remotely by the human voice, proving that "the apparatus foreshadowed broadcasting: the human voice actually did create effects at the receiving end," both for machines and humans.  Gernsback consistently reminds us that the inherent abilities of wireless, i.e. of information transmitted through the air, has now itself been scattered by the winds of technological evolution and inflects our understanding of and interaction with a fantastic number of techniques, technologies, and media.

definitely use, then delete or rephrase from 193107 Television Technique:

[^rqrn]: Gernsback's first editorial for this magazine emphasized a slightly different point: that the large corporations---who by necessity had to be depended on to produce these incredibly complex and expensive technologies---were actually stifling competition by "jealously guarding whatever improvements are made, because these large firms naturally wish to come out with a complete set that can be sold ready-made to the public."  Continuing his argument that communities of amateur tinkerers, openly sharing their results, were a necessary element in the development of new media, Gernsback continues:

    > Everyone knows that, the more people who are working on an art, the more rapid the progress will be in the end.  Many improvements in radio have been due to experimenters who started in a small way and, later on, became outstanding figures in radio. … The more experimenters and the more television fans who become interested in the art, the quicker it will advance and the sooner it will be put on the stable basis which it deserves.

    

    He saw *Television News* as providing an entry point for this community of amateur television experimenters that had yet to come into being:  "To this purpose I am dedicating this new publication, and the future will demonstrate the correctness of the assumption."
