In order to preserve a sense of the overlapping…

These thematic categories overlap, with Gernsback touching on his ideas about predicting the future in articles on tinkering, for instance.  It is meant as a suggestion, an entry point for further browsing.

The titles of Gernsback essays that appear in this collection are formatted in bold.

Begin with stuff from Cheng, Astounding Wonder, on stories from readers.  Hiding issues beneath shirts, trying to trade to get a complete set and finish a novel.  Asimov too?  Charles D. Hornig in interview, Pioneers of Wonder 65:  At 14 years old, went to the movies after his mom gave him a quarter.  Instead, "walkedi nto this drugstore which had a newsrack.  I saw this magazine cover which showed the Chrysler Building being uprooted in flames.  That was very exciting.  It was the September 1930 *Amazing Stories.*  I bought it out of curiosity and walked across the street to the library and began reading it.  Within minutes, though, the librarian threw me out.  *'You can't bring that kind of trash in here!' she yelled.  So I took it home and read it.  And I was hooked.  It had an installment of "Skylark Three" by E.E. Smith and a number of other goods tories.  It was like an LSD experience, a sort of opening up of my mind, a feeling of awe and wonder---*it was fantastic!*"

The thematic TOC is meant only as a navigational aid. As you will see, the categories bleed into one another with articles touching on multiple topics at once. Part of the argument of this book is that tinkering *is* fiction, that a critical understanding of television was itself a scientifictional enterprise, and so on.

Stuff on selected stories from Ralph and Sci Adventures: not for reasons of space, but to approximate the experience of readers who sometimes would only have access to one issue, who weren't subscribers but would read free issues and trade freely in letters section.  including only single installments from each gernsback novel will mirror the experience for readers who had trouble finding every issue of a novel and tried to trade and collect to get the complete story.  in a way, it’s a gesture toward re-opening this kind of community for modern readers who might want to find the stories for themselves.  See cheng_astounding p. 69 for more on this.

Be prepared for Gernsback to repeat himself, favorite examples he always has in his back pocket like Verne's submarine or ... -- one must remember that, writing multiple editorials each week, he was a pulp media theorist, a craftsman of ideas in the same way that his writers were.

This book as a whole, and Gernsback's life work, is one big science fictional world. Interleaving devices and projections and stories. I need to thread them together smoothly, as a story.

There's a consistency among all the devices listed in Gernsback's stories and articles, as if this entire collection of writings is part of the same worldbuilding fabric, a single narrative universe he sought to create out of his electrical parts catalogue

Selection criteria:  both representative and uniquely interesting.

This selection is meant as an invitation to further digging.

These essays represent the hight of Gernsback's output, from his first ever piece of published writing to some of the first editorials he worte after the bankruptcy of Experimenter Publishing in February 1929.

(For a complete list of the fiction published in the Gernsback magazines from *Modern Electrics* on, see **The Evolution of Modern Science Fiction.**)

In many ways this book can be read as a coherent work of science fiction in its own right, developed over the course of thirty years but a coherent project
