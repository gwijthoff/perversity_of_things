while people like Tesla had already established the fact that invention was part of an entire discursive network of speculations, projections, etc., Gernsback was able to popularize these forms of using technology.  His work is all about amateurs thinking in the same way, and everyday people feeling this amazement as they use technology, not as dumb spectators with their minds blown by the magician Tesla, but as active participants.  Which actually makes him an interesting figure in Lori Emerson's argument that technology today (Apple especially) has become too magical.  Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.

There was more than a little competition at work here, magicians discrediting other magicians through tricks of the trade that couldn't be revealed.

Magicians discrediting other magicians:  Landy, How to Do Things With Fictions:  "In the wake of [Jean-Eugène] Robert-Houdin, more or less every magician adopted sober evening dress, and more or less every magician took a swipe at something while on stage, whether past impostors, present spiritualists, or even his own tricks.  The demolition of lingering belief in actual sorcery became, thanks to Robert-Houdin, a primary function of the magic show at large."

in the early 18th century, "Robertson and Rubens Peale were presenting their 'phantasmagorias' as the very antidote to belief" (Cook, 172-3, 177)
