[wireless]

"radiophone" still being used as late as 192302_who_will_save

Wireless as an inherently elevated, intellectual phenomenon.  Ethereal, both in how raw minerals like zinc and copper can be used to communicate through the air for miles and miles, but the fact that voices now exist on the air, that we can commune in that way:  "the most inspiring example of the triumph of mind over matter," from "A Treatise."  Later in an article on regulation, says, "We are now on the threshold of the wireless era, and just beginning to rub our intellectual eyes, as it were" ("Wireless Association of America").

overarching story

------------------

The amateur avant garde:  

> The set builder naturally is well able to compete with the manufacturer, for two reasons. First, his time costs him little, and in price, therefore, he can compete easily with the factory-made set. Secondly, he has the jump on the manufactured set for the simple reason that, as like as not, his circuit is the latest out, and, therefore, will have improvements that the manufactured set can not boast for some months to come.

Though HG and collaborators feel left out of the broadcast boom, Radio News is still a beacon for tinkerers around the world, who feel that their sets are far superior to the "average" sets sold by companies, in department stores, etc., and that they serve as the vanguard of advancing the "science."

A trip back to the archives for forgotten curiosities in radio history, both to educate an expanding public on precisely how this technology works, and to find new paths forward that may have been overlooked.

In 192704_radio_steps_out, it's shown how radio technology infuses many other devices and media, including sound film and the phonograph.  The interweaving of these seemingly disparate cultural forms just goes to show how much emerging media were a product of alchemical combinations between components and imaginaries -- the idea here being that "radio" could have been anything, not just the consumer-friendly broadcast medium it was being solidified as in 1927.  Given a different combination of shared elements between new media, many other configurations were possible.

Historical context:  American nationalist/colonialist aspirations after the Spanish American War is an important context for thinking about networking (and securing) a public, a polity, as well as the question of whose future was being imagined as existing within this public, whose wonder in the face of self-awareness as being a part of this public.  See the footnote in "Wired Radio Versus Space Radio" on strategic control of submarine cables.

A classic SF question: how can national borders remain with global networks unifying all peoples?

In a sense, G's optimism about technological progress is only possible in the unscathed US after World War I.

"The radiophone will link moving humanity with the stationary one." (**The Future of Wireless**)  Things such as Wireless Tele-Mechanics (v2n03 p. 112), surveying the wide and almost limitless range of applications for the new techniques of wireless.  (Radio Kinetics elsewhere?)  not just moving humanity with stationary, but translating human motion and agency from one space to another.

Later, when the technology and the regulation of radio becomes too complicated for amateurs to follow, when WRNY is forced to shut down by the FCC because it's too small, we see a different track being taken (can draw on diss chapter here for Gernsback's archaeology of radio):

	Exactly one year after Hugo Gernsback launched Amazing Stories, the first American magazine devoted solely to publishing what would later be called science fiction, he returned his attention to the wireless industry that had given him his start in publishing.  In an April 1927 editorial for his flagship electronics publication, Radio News, Gernsback asked his readers to forget everything they knew about radio.  With the rise of big broadcast networks and programs, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people’s minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology.

There was a day, many years ago, when radio was not ‘radio’ at all, but merely ‘wireless.’  The art at that time was merely one of communication; that is, the transmission of intelligence by signals from one point to another without intervening wires.  So things stood, more or less, until the advent of the vacuum tube, after which soon followed the first really successful wireless telephone, which today we term the ‘radiophone,’ as applied to broadcasting.  

By 1927, the radio was firmly cemented in the American mind as an everyday piece of household furniture.  Not only were radios rapidly spreading into every American home after the “radio Christmas” of 1924, but the legislative frameworks that would determine the structure of American broadcasting were finally being hammered out.  1927 was the year that the Federal Radio Commission, established by the Radio Act of 1927, came to power, replacing the Department of Commerce as having power to regulate and divide radio stations.  Government regulation of radio had been anticipated for some time, and congressional debates were held as early as 190… over the wild west of the airwaves and how to prevent interference (of the then narrow range of tunable frequencies) and mischief (relaying false messages to ships).  Gernsback tried to forestall this government regulation, proposing an amateur-run and amateur-governed body known as the Wireless Association of America.  First blue book of operators and frequencies, the “Wireless Registry,” published in the May 1909 Modern Electrics.

	And how much of the reporting Gernsback was doing on these policy debates at the time must have been a matter of speculation.  Much of the regulation battles Gernsback was reporting on must largely have been a matter of conjecture on little bits of information received and reported on by the newspapers.  Much of the negotiations between the FTC, RCA and AT&T were done behind closed doors.  “And all of this maneuvering that could have so altered American communications and culture transpired behind the scrim of corporate confidentiality, not to be made public until scholarly investigation decades later.”  (Wu 80)

	Gernsback’s publications avidly followed these debates using the highly specialized language and expertise reminiscent of today’s tech press / gadget bloggers…  What makes this difficult is that the legislation wasn’t the only variable in the stories… “radio” itself was a moving target.  Susan Douglas:  during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, “the press’s method of covering and interpreting technological change was developed.  In other words, what scholars have identified as the functions of the mass media in the late twentieth century were being formulated and refined during the first twenty-three years of radio’s history.”

	Gernsback would have a very rapid change of heart in the coming year, when the Federal Radio Commission included his own WRNY in its list of 164 smaller-scale stations who had to justify their existence or be forced to shut down.

	Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying “wireless telegraphy,” or more simply “wireless,” as it was known under the Marconi configuration, became “radio,” that everyday part of household furniture, Gernsback writes:

But radio does not stop here, although the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy.”

True to form for Gernsback, a notorious self-promoter, many of the following examples were either invented by him, or “now famous” devices that were first written about and introduced to the public in the pages of Modern Electrics, Gernsback’s first magazine, which ran from 1908 to 1913.  The Dynamophone, for instance, “an apparatus whereby it was possible, with the human voice, to start an electric motor or any other electrical appliance from a distance.”  Or… find more examples

These contradictions [extolling the virtues of the amateur and the tinkerer while being bankrolled by RCA and AT&T(?) advertising revenue] abounded in the pages of Gernsback’s publications.  

1925 Sept -- "General Harbord Explains the Patent Situation" 252+ president of RCA.  192509

The May 1920 issue (v8n1) described C.D. Wagoner, “The New Radio Corporation,” on the formation of RCA, and two years later, their ads were being run in HG publications:  “[RCA ad]” p. 877.  Science and Invention Jan 1922, v9n9  RCA ads in a Gernsback mag as early as Jan 1922.  “Listening to Broadcasted News and Music from the Radio Telephone.”  In bed with their money early on.  

From **Radio Enters Into a New Phase,** HG defends patents as a monopoly:  RCA holds a patent on virtually every important radio related invention.  Gernsback argues that every patent is a monopoly.  Any small set manufacturer has to pay expensive royalties, phasing out all but the largest firms.  G is strangely optimistic about this possibility:  “What has been predicted for a number of years has thus come to pass.  The radio set business will be in the hands of a few strong corporations, which will control the legitimate set business in the United States on a highly competitive basis.  All other reports to the contrary, this certainly is not a general monopoly of the set business; and we believe that, in time to come, it will work out to the advantage of the public.”  But set manufacturers are slower to change than the experimenter.

As Tim Wu argues, Radio News even served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country’s history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and “what one might expect to hear on them—a forerunner of the once hugely profitable TV Guide” (39)  What these lists reveal is that much of the chatter on the air as early as 1922 came from corporate sources:  “many early stations were run by radio manufacturers such as Westinghouse, the pioneer of the ready-to-plug-in model [a claim Gernsback would certainly dispute], and RCA, botho f which had an obvious interest in promoting the medium.  Still many stations were run by amateurs, ‘radio clubs,’ universities, churches, hotels, poultry farms, newspapers, the U.S. Army and Navy” (39).

	The example of the lists (apparently published many times in Radio News?) cited by Wu is Armstrong Perry, “What Anyone Can Hear: Complete List of Broadcasting Stations in U.S.”  March 1922, 814.

In the **Radio Broadcasting** issue, another article by Mrs. Christine Frederick, “The Radiophone Now a Household Necessity”

Gernsback, “Radio Town Crier”, illustration of a massive skyscraper that broadcasts audio news, in v11n10 192402

G., “The Garrett Inventor” v15n11, 192803 — “It was pointed out, in all sincerity, that no great inventions could possibly come from the small inventor in the future.” …  “The story sounded plausible enough, because in all of the laboratories of our large industrial companies, research scientists are busy, day and night, in inventing and perfecting new devices.”  Gives examples of how this is not the case. 

“By July 1928 … Gernsback was convinced that experimenter culture existed only as an ideal.  He had been running a monthly contest that rewarded radio constructors for ‘novel and practical sets’ (“Radio News Monthly Prize”).  But too many entries featured only hackneyed old ideas or worse, no sign of practical development at all.  By January 1929, Gernsback killed the contest in palpable disgust for the people who called themselves experimenters (“End of Monthly).”  (Drown 100) 

Andrew Ross:  “Industrial corporations either controlled or purchased most invention patents, hoarding them in order to suppress competition, while independent inventors lacked the big capital that was increasingly required for research and development of their alternative technologies.  As a result, the explosive age of industrial invention lay in the past, viewed as much too volatile in its effects for the scientifically regulated process of production favored by monopoly capitalism.  The new emphasis on control, precision, uniformity, predictability, and standardization meant the extinction of the entrepreneur-inventor, whose heyday had included the likes of George Westinghouse, Francis Richards, Edward Weston, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Lee De Forest, Elihu Thomson, Charles Brush, Charles Hall, Edward Dean Acheson, and Elmer Sperry.  While scientists became increasingly ‘proletarianized,’ the new Fordist compromise meant that monopoly cartels, often in agreement with labor unions, would seek new uses for old technology rather than risking the potential instability offered by new labor-saving, and ecologically sound, technologies.” (124)
