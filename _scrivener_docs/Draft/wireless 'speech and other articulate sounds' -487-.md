"radiophone" still being used as late as 192302_who_will_save

Wireless as an inherently elevated, intellectual phenomenon.  Ethereal, both in how raw minerals like zinc and copper can be used to communicate through the air for miles and miles, but the fact that voices now exist on the air, that we can commune in that way:  "the most inspiring example of the triumph of mind over matter," from "A Treatise."  Later in an article on regulation, says, "We are now on the threshold of the wireless era, and just beginning to rub our intellectual eyes, as it were" ("Wireless Association of America").

overarching story

------------------

The amateur avant garde:  

> The set builder naturally is well able to compete with the manufacturer, for two reasons. First, his time costs him little, and in price, therefore, he can compete easily with the factory-made set. Secondly, he has the jump on the manufactured set for the simple reason that, as like as not, his circuit is the latest out, and, therefore, will have improvements that the manufactured set can not boast for some months to come.

points

Though HG and collaborators feel left out of the broadcast boom, Radio News is still a beacon for tinkerers around the world, who feel that their sets are far superior to the "average" sets sold by companies, in department stores, etc., and that they serve as the vanguard of advancing the "science."

A trip back to the archives for forgotten curiosities in radio history, both to educate an expanding public on precisely how this technology works, and to find new paths forward that may have been overlooked.

In 192704_radio_steps_out, it's shown how radio technology infuses many other devices and media, including sound film and the phonograph.  The interweaving of these seemingly disparate cultural forms just goes to show how much emerging media were a product of alchemical combinations between components and imaginaries -- the idea here being that "radio" could have been anything, not just the consumer-friendly broadcast medium it was being solidified as in 1927.  Given a different combination of shared elements between new media, many other configurations were possible.

Historical context:  American nationalist/colonialist aspirations after the Spanish American War is an important context for thinking about networking (and securing) a public, a polity, as well as the question of whose future was being imagined as existing within this public, whose wonder in the face of self-awareness as being a part of this public.  See the footnote in "Wired Radio Versus Space Radio" on strategic control of submarine cables.

A classic SF question: how can national borders remain with global networks unifying all peoples?

In a sense, G's optimism about technological progress is only possible in the unscathed US after World War I.
