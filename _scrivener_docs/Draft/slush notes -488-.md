scientifiction

==========

By the late 1920s the editorials and my notes become more about the readers and the movement Gernsback started than any ideas coming specifically from him any more. He had set something in motion, and a community took it from there.

A copyrighted term, according to @westfahl_mightiest_2015, p. 18? 

Delany defending the pulps as the true starting point for science fiction, that “precritical period of SF in which all the difficulties of the world are presented as amenable to scientific solution”:  “The academic literary critics who, slowly, have made this the history of my genre are largely people who come out of a critical tradition where the ‘value of literature’ is often assumed to be that it ‘expresses the spirit of the times.’  These critics work in an intellectual landscape where science fiction is a devalued form and considered a debased writing.  Their overwhelming urge is to legitimate it; the overwhelmingly available method of legitimation is to create a history for it that ‘expresses the times.’  Since the technological concerns are still there in the *Analog* stories of the early forties, these critics highlight them—there—for the purpose of that legitimating history—even though those technological concerns express little or none of what is specifically interesting, new, overwhelmingly evident, or, most importantly, at odds with the establishment literary concerns (i.e., before the war, the critique of the philosophy of science and after it the exciting range of historical plurality in the SF of that period.

     “… But more important than all of this, what gets lost in this second history is that the writers of SF of this period were themselves, overwhelmingly, marginal—always marginal economically, often marginal politically (frequently to the left but sometimes, as with Heinlein, to the right).  And they were writing in a tradition that was, first, wholly and openly expelled by the literary establishment of the United STates.  Second, they were writing within a dtradition that has always seen itself opposed to the social and cultural mainstream.    That, indeed, this tradition has a history of its own, different from that of either ‘literature’ or ‘the times,’ concerned with different values—concerned with values different from those that the mainstream of our culture would occasionally attribute to it—should be expected.” @delany_silent_1994, 156-7.

“On Reprints” editorial on difficulty of finding quality historical SF, both because of publishing rights but also because it just doesn’t hold up to the stuff being published by 1933.  Which wasn’t the case in 1926, when almost entirely reprints.  In six years, an overage of new stories being produced.  But while he gets a lot of stories, apparently it’s hard to find stories that are scientifically “plausible” up to his standards.  See “Reasonableness in SF” 1932.

Westfahl in intro to “How to Write Science Stories”: "And, by patiently explaining available resources and possible strategies for writers who are unfamiliar with science, Gernsback demonstrates a willingness to employ writers who lack a scientific background. The article thus serves to correct some common misconceptions about Gernsback's editorial philosophy and policies."

American-specific SF

===============

“We can now understand precisely why American science fiction became widely recognized as the best science fiction in the world.  It had a name that conveyed and imposed a special sense of identity, firmly associated with science; it was buttressed by arguments testifying to its unique value and significance; it was vigorously supported by armies of dedicated fans eager to both promote and critique its works; it was centered on a characteristic narrative that was exciting and colorful enough to attract a broad range of readers; and these adventures were accompanied by more distinguished stories rooted in a more challenging agenda that could appeal to literary connoisseurs.  In contrast, the imaginative literatures of other nations lacked a recognized name, were not clearly associated with science, were not buttressed by arguments about their singular virtues, did not enjoy organized support, and were not anchored by an involving narrative pattern in alliance with more thought-provoking efforts.” (@westfahl_mightiest_2015, 27)

SF is inherently about world-consciousness, so a focus on American SF goes against the spirit of the genre:  “Given the genre’s origins and favored themes it is not surprising that none of the major scholarly journals devoted to SF criticism are nation-specific in their orientation.” (@canavan_introduction_2015, 3)

“The simple premise of the present volume, then, despite all of these caveats, is that the science ficitonal imagination is so fundamental to the arc of history across the so-called American Century that we might productively talk about a specifically American SF.  Many of the ideas, themes, and conventions of contemporary science fiction take their roots in a disctinctively American cultural experience, and so SF in America serves as a provocative index to twentieth- and twenty-first-century American culture, reflecting America’s hopes, desires, ambitions, and fears.” @canavan_introduction_2015, 4

readership & fandom

===============

AS published letters with readers’s addresses

Think about the phrase “communities of practice” to name both what groups of tinkerers do and groups of readers/fans do

A tradition that goes all the way back to the Correspondence section in *Modern Electrics.*  "Wrinkles, Recipes and Formulas” and “The Oracle" in the pages of *Science and Invention*

Delany: “the vast tributary system of informal criticism” (Starboard Wine, 238)

Andrew Ross:  “in Gernsback’s view, sf was more a social than a literary movement” (103)

Also, community of wireless operators.  Right after article on signaling to Mars (190905), the introduction of the Wireless Blue Book — individuals, people lighting up on a wireless map, as if soon the Martians will be in the addressable Blue Book too.

Craftsmanship of writing SF

=====================

SF studies questions about the quality and aesthetic merit of early stories (and their dislike for Gernsback era stories, and favoring of Campbell stuff) misses the point.  This was about craft not art.

“pulp writers saw themselves as skilled tradespeople.”  Editors referred to an “author” as a mark of distinction, using “writer” anywhere else.  “When a pulp magazine referred to an ‘author,’ the term distinguished the writer of its main story or serial installment from short-story writers who filledn ecessary space toward its back secitons.” @cheng_astounding_2012, 28

“Use of the term ‘writer’ rather than ‘author’ expressed the priorities within pulp publishing.  The product of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary developments, the term ‘author’ maintained class and cultural distinction, suggesting creative artists whose literary publication marked and establisehd their individual merit.  The term ‘writer’ referred to tradesmen, cultural workers who produced or, perhaps more appropriately, manufactured storeis for publications, work that was nevertheless dstill distinguished by skill and craftsmanship.” @cheng_astounding_2012, 27

see Samuel R. Delany on this point:  “…a tradition of writers who considered themselves craftsmen first and artists secondarily, if at all.” @delany_silent_1994, 200.

magazine publishing business

=====================

A dummy magazine is a prototype produced solely to trademark the publication’s title with the U.S. Patent Office before that magazine has ever been mass produced.  According to Sam Moskowitz, “Customarily only a few copies, rarely more than a dozen, of any one issue of such dummy magazines are produced, for the law requires only that you must show proof that you were paid for three copies in order to register the trademark.”  @moskowitz_gernsback_1971.  Examples of titles Gernsback submitted to the Patent Office in the form of dummy magazines that never materialized as full publications include *Scientific Detective Monthly* (1929),  *Buccaneer Stories* (1934), *Exploration Tales: Thrilling Stories and Novels of Past and Present Soldiers of Fortune* (1934), *True Supernatural Stories* (1934), and *Prescience Fiction* (1952).

Emphasis on forum, but a debased one:  

	James Gunn, Alternate Worlds: The Illustrated History of SF:  “Gernsback provided a focus for enthusiasm, for publication, for development.  He may not have shaped modern science fiction… but he provided a place for science fiction to be shaped.  Looking back on the place, it may have been a ghetto, but it was a golden ghetto, a place of brotherhood and opportunity and wonder.  Before Gernsback there were science fiction stories.  After Gernsback, there was a science fiction genre.” (128) 

	Malcolm J. Edwards:  in ESF:  G “gave the genre a local habitation and a name,” and “bestowed upon his creation provincial dogmatism and an illiteracy that bedeviled US SF for years.”

	Aldiss (sets the disparaging tone for some years):  as Landon Brooks puts it, summarizing the current state of scholarship (or lack thereof) on Gernsback, influenced by Aldiss:  “Gernsback’s approach to science fiction was so crude and heavy-handed that it actually initiated most of the negative stereotypes that have been advanced to disparage science fiction” (54).

	Landon Brooks, leaving questions of quality aside, writes that Amazing Stories was “the first true science fiction magazine—the birthplace of genre science fiction,” and Gernsback was “science fiction’s first great editor and critic.”
