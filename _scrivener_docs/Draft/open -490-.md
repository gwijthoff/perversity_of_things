It's the summer of 1906 in downtown Manhattan and Louis Coggeshall hovers over a bucket of dimes in the back room of the Electro Importing Company's retail store, filing them down to a coarse powder.  Sitting amid shelves of electrolytic detectors, circuit switches, ammeters, and Geissler tubes ready for sale to the city's growing community of amateur experimenters, he lets the metal filings fall into a small cardboard box at his feet.  Making a coherer, one of the earliest forms of radio receiver, required a certain amount of culinary improvisation in order to find the proportion of metals that would produce the strongest signal possible.  At the time, dimes were minted on ninety percent silver, so Coggeshall’s next steps were to mix the filings with the perfect ratio of iron powder and finally to pour that mixture into a small glass vial.[^mrc]  When a radio frequency wave comes into contact with this coherer, the metal filings cling together, allowing a signal to flow between electrodes connected to either end of the vial and, depending on how long the telegraph key on the transmitting end of that radio wave is depressed, produce a *dot* or a *dash* in Morse code.  Mounting this final element onto a wooden base dotted with other handmade components, Coggeshall completes the construction of another one of the Electro Importing Company's flagship products: the Telimco, a portmanteau of the company's name and one of the first fully-assembled radio sets ever sold to the American public. ^[@_telimco_2002. @gernsback_50_1956. @gernsback_old_1938.]

Meanwhile in the offices upstairs, the founder of Electro Importing Hugo Gernsback writes increasingly breathless advertising copy for the Telimco, promising it to be a means of professional success and economic mobility.  In one issue of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog*---a mail-in marketplace that provided access to "Everything for the Experimenter"---Gernsback claimed that with the Telimco, "We give you the opportunity to tick yourself up to the head of a future wireless telegraph company as did Marconi, De Forest and others."  Priced at $7.50, the set was an attractive proposition from a company who claimed to be "the largest makers of experimental Wireless Material in the world", requiring little more than a working knowledge of Morse code in order to get started.  First advertised in the November 25, 1905 issue of *Scientific American,* the Telimco appeared thereafter every two weeks, quickly becoming one of Electro Importing's best selling items.  In order to reach a wider public, Gernsback visited retailers around the city like Macy’s, Gimbels, Marshall Field's, and FAO Schwartz, giving demonstrations of the device to incredulous salespeople who had no conceptual framework through which to understand “wireless.”  And for good reason: not only was wireless still in its infancy and largely unknown to the public, it was a technology whose successful transmission of information through the air wasn’t fully understood even by the scientific community.  From the physical substrate of metal filings to an entirely new means of communication that would soon be in every home, Gernsback and his colleagues were in the process of transubstantiating one medium into a medium of another kind.

This is the story of a literary genre's emergence.  But it is likely not one that the reader is familiar with.  While Hugo Gernsback is remembered today as the founding editor of the first science fiction magazine, *Amazing Stories,* this book is devoted to the idea that the project of science fiction in fact had its origins among the community of tinkerers and hams reading Gernsback's earlier technology magazines.  *Amazing Stories* debuted on newsstands in April 1926, a glossy, large format magazine that gave a name to fiction treating the fantastic through a realistic lens.  It established a forum for fans of the genre to debate and influence the future of its development.  In recognition of this legacy, the Hugo Awards are given out each year to the best works in the genre.  Today, the term *science fiction* conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, and starships.  But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before the accretion of a hundred years' worth of narratives, images, and clichés, that which was not yet called science fiction consisted of a great number of concrete practices all geared toward a reckoning with technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life.

![Electro Importing Company advertisement in *Modern Electrics* (1908).](images/christmas_suggestions.jpg)

Beginning with the array of exotic equipment on display in the *Electro Importing Catalog* and continuing into magazines like *Modern Electrics* (first published in 1908), *Electrical Experimenter* (1913), and *Radio News* (1919), Gernsback developed a speculative language for describing and assessing the cultural impact of new media.  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog* seemed---solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes---Gernsback and his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appeared as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one could pick and choose from of the pages of the *Catalog.*  

We have to put ourselves in the mindset of a world in which there is no such thing as "science fiction."  Not only that, but science itself had many contested meanings, and "technology" was a word that hand't even entered the English lexicon, as we will see later.

In part, this is a book about the origins of American science fiction.  It’s also a look at the emergence of new media around community practices rather than new technical standards or innovations.  But in order to understand both processes, we have to put ourselves into a mindset, understand that there was no such thing as a *genre* of fiction that took place in the future.  There was no such thing as radio, and even further, no sufficient explanation for how the technology worked.  This is a story about science fiction, technology, radio, media studies, all terms that did not yet exist in the lexicon and still played an important role, they existed as discourse without keywords.

Technical literacy was encouraged not only through blueprints and instruction manuals for the amateur tinkerer, but also through thought experiments and graphical projections of what these new media might look like.  This was Gernsback's forté: reading fantastic possibilities for the future of technologically advanced societies off the shape of the most mundane of material objects, techniques and processes.

No understanding of sci, tech, and certainly no modern sense of "media" at the time.  So, when I say that this is an origin point for media studies, it's not in writings about cinema or early radio programming.  It's in an attention to  the affordances of the smallest individual components:  the selenium-coated plate, the tungsten lamp, the chromic plunge battery.  In the blueprints of *Modern Electrics* all the way through the short fiction of *Amazing Stories*, the addition and subtraction of each wire, condenser, or tuning hookup constituted a full-scale shift in the abilities and sensory affects of the apparatus being constructed as well as the narrative form through which it was described.  Moreover, these publications developed interleaving descriptive and narrative frameworks within which to describe these devices and experiences.  No longer was it sufficient to profile the technical specifications of a device or the mechanical arrangement of its parts.  Instead, magazines like *Radio News* and *Science and Invention* followed technological developments through to their most logical, and sometimes extreme, conclusions:  the increased availability of a light-sensitive alloy implied that the coming of visual telephones was near, and the number of amateurs sending in their own designs for primitive television receivers only served to confirm the immanence of this new mode of communication.

The Telimco was one of countless artifacts profiled in the Gernsback magazines that blurred the lines between the real and the imaginary.  Part branding exercise, part rallying call for a community of active amateur experimenters, Gernsback gave names to these ideas like the Aerophone (a name for wireless audio transmission, rather than merely telegraphic code), the Telephot (an early conceptualization of the videophone), and the Hypnobioscope (an automated thought transcription and playback machine).  These gadgets appeared so frequently and in such diverse contexts---as props in short stories, as homemade designs in letters to the editor, as profiles of similar developments across Europe---that one gets the sense paging through the magazines that they are all part of a coherent fictional world, built up across many years and many issues.  Given the pace of technological change in the early twentieth century, it seemed as if any one element of this fictional world could bleed into everyday life at any moment.

* * * * 

The Telimco, for instance, was not exactly the revolutionary device that first brought radio to the masses Gernsback later liked to claim it was.  Though its advertisements claimed the set was "guaranteed to work up to one mile," the Telimco was notoriously finicky.^[@_wireless_1905]  As it was sold, the outfit had a range of merely 300-500 feet and could only receive signals from further distances when a large antenna was hooked up.  Further, it was highly susceptible to any kind of electrical interference, such as the elevator motor in the Electro Importing Company building, which caused difficulties during in-store demonstrations of the apparatus.  The Telimco's untuned circuits, which would produce a high degree of interference for any nearby radio station, would soon be outlawed by federal legislation.  For these reasons, its metal filings coherers "had all but disappeared from commercial work in 1910" according to historian of early radio Thomas White.^[@white_pioneering_1996]  From this perspective, the Telimco seems less a practical means of communication than a proof of concept for a growing group of "electrics" hobbyists.  In essence, it was little more than a gimmick, a parlor trick: press a button and a bell in another room would ring without the need for any intervening wires.

This didn't stop Gernsback from publishing instructions in 1908 on connecting a telephone mouthpiece to the transmitting end of the Telimco and an engine to the receiving end, so that the "power" of the human voice could be used to start that engine (**The Dynamophone**).  Or in the following year, describing how thousands of perfectly synchronized home wireless sets would be capable of sending a message to the aliens that surely must be listening for us on Mars (**Signaling to Mars**).  Or months later, laying out in great technical detail how it would be possible to send and receive motion pictures over the airwaves using currently available equipment (**Television and the Telephot**).  Designing a new technology that could be played with by amateur users was only ever the first step for Gernsback.  These technologies were always elaborated through projections of how they might work in the future, it was the way in which they were explained.  … These were handicraft futures that would come to pass with just a little more tinkering.

***** magazine history - transition? *****

While nineteenth-century scientific periodicals in the United States took the form of highly specialized *Proceedings* or *Transactions* or *Reports* of professional research groups, the *fin de siécle* saw a proliferation of titles aimed at a broader audience.  *Scientific American* for instance, the best known of these publications and one that still runs today, attracted a readership that included credentialed researchers, industrial manufacturers, an interested general public, as well as a "nebulous community of inventors (ranging from the local tinkerer to manufacturer and professional inventor/technologist)."  Science in these new magazines was made accessible to a growing number of readers seeking to educate themselves or simply desiring to remain informed about recent developments.[^psci]

[^psci]: @whalen_periodicals_1980.  For a history of the view that a scientifically educated public was an imperative for American democracy in the early twentieth century, a period during which the concept of "science" itself was in flux, see @jewett_science_2014, especially Chapters 4 and 7.

But while Gernsback's magazines may seem familiar to us today through their progeny such as *Wired,* *Popular Science,* and *Popular Mechanics* (the latter two of which are the direct successors to Gernsback titles) in many ways they bear more in common with a deeper tradition of popular science that blurred the lines between illusion and truth, skepticism and belief.  From medieval displays of the natural world's wondrous curiosities, to renaissance performances of… [ANOTHER EX FROM DASTON], to nineteenth-century phantasmagoria and other audiovisual spectacles, "the positive sciences and the fantastic arts [have been] linked in a dialectic of doubt and certainty."^[@tresch_prophet_2011; @daston_wonders_1998; @andriopoulos_ghostly_2013.]  Unseen forces were at work in the miracle of wireless telegraphy, a literally unbelievable technology that meant disembodied voices from around the world could be skimmed from the air in the comfort of your home.  If this miracle were possible, what else might be?

From a belief in the presence of the luminiferous ether, to an argument that gravity is an electrical phenomenon, to the suggestion that humans may be able to tap into the so-called sixth senses of animals, or that the earth's core is made of radium and drives recurring cycles of life's evolution, certain Gernsback titles reveled in the scandalous yet somehow strangely intuitive realms of scientific speculation.^[@gernsback_ether_1916; @gernsback_gravitation_1918; @gernsback_unknown_1920; @gernsback_radium_1916]

Writes a lot in the 1919-1922 period, esp. in Science and Invention, about dormant forces all around us, unknown, unseen, and not yet understood — just as electricity was to the ancients.  Gravitation, attraction, etc.  Esp. “Into the Unknown, S&I v10n8.  See also Gernsback, “Alice in Sound-Land,” in which Hugo meets Alice, and shows him his Sonophones, turn any frequency (X-Ray, solar radioation, etc) into audible sound for the human ear, and walk around listening to invisible things. Also, “Invisible Worlds,” SI 6/24“@pseudoscience

See @pseudoscience tag!

G., “Modern Illusions,” on how our understanding of, willing belief in, and acceptance of illusions have increased to such a crazy amount, from cinema to the telephone to neon street signs.  Somehow ties this in to whether or not we should trust our senses in science, re: illusions.  Ties back in to “Invisible Worlds” piece. v15n03 192707

v3n6 191510, anon, “Can Electricity Transfer Thought Waves.”  This issue starts pushing in new directions with what electricity makes possible, and its epistemology — as gravitation, as the substance of thought.

v4n6 191610 -- Gernsback, “Electrical Frauds.”  Ironically, this profile of ridiculous ideas that are just marketing ploys is the page after Gernsback’s editorial on how gravity is an electrical phenomenon that can be overcome.  Accompanied by images — all are bodily — electrical arch supports, hair growers, hair grower, etc. “P.T. Barnum was right: ‘The people want to be fooled!’”

	v12n02 192406 -- G, “Invisible Worlds” — on how while you read this, invisible microbes and radio waves and radiation are passing through you without you even knowing it.  We shouldn’t trust our eyes anymore in this day and age.  “We will then reverse the old adage—‘seeing is believing’ into ‘not seeing is believing.’” 

	v13n08 192512 -- G, “How Science Affects Our Lives” — we forget that science is all around us 

Yes some speculative pseudoscience, but at the same time a hard-nosed approach to applied science, with real practical results.  Building a new form of crystal radio set (**Radioson**) whose performance could not only rival new tube sets, but were much cheaper, easier to fix, and most importantly, more easily understood by home experimenters.  A tinkerer's ethic.

A moment in which the specialist orientation of the sciences was opened up to a wider public who had a lot of questions.  This was not only because there was an audience for science, but also because the products of science were all around us.  Science fiction was a response to new experiences in everyday life.

The (paleolithic?) archaeologist and historian of radio Michael Schiffer calls Gernsback and his associates "techno-mancers," and that their stories created a "cultural imperative" for the new media they envisioned, like pocket-sized radios and color television (136).

What was new about Gernsback's approach is that this understanding of the complexities of the natural and artificial world would come about through the hands: handicraft and making.

At work here is a certain form of magic, when we don’t know how something works but we can see that, plainly, it does (see Mauss).  Our suspicion is elicited, nonetheless.  It’s also a form of advertising rhetoric, a hucksterism to sell more sets.  A more charitable version of this would say that HG was out to build a genuine community of practice around building, tinkering, and communicating through this new medium in the making.  But this is also about prototyping the future — understanding what the future will be like, setting up the conditions in which we can assess and critique its coming, with ready to hand, available material objects.  "Beauty is a groping of the emotions towards realization of things which may be unknown only to the intellect." 192607 Fiction Versus Facts

	while people like Tesla had already established the fact that invention was part of an entire discursive network of speculations, projections, etc., Gernsback was able to popularize these forms of using technology.  His work is all about amateurs thinking in the same way, and everyday people feeling this amazement as they use technology, not as dumb spectators with their minds blown by the magician Tesla, but as active participants.  Which actually makes him an interesting figure in Lori Emerson's argument that technology today (Apple especially) has become too magical.  Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.

This is what Gernsback called “the perversity of things,” or the innate capacity of objects to elicit unique responses in users, skilled or novice.  (briefly introduce)

Titled after an essay of his on the influence that objects exert on thought, *The Perversity of Things: Writings on Media, Technology, and Science Fiction* makes available texts by Gernsback that were foundational for both science fiction and the emergence of media studies.  These editorials, speculative blueprints, literary critical essays, and media histories have been out of print since their original publication in Gernsback's magazines from 1905-1933.  Together, they show how his publications evolved from an electrical parts catalog into a fully-fledged literary genre, an altogether untold story in American literary and media history.  As the curator of a recent exhibit on Gernsback at the ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology), Franz Pichler writes, "Hugo Gernsback is the father of American electronic culture."^[@pichler_hugo_2013]  With his monthly editorials, feature articles, and short fiction, Gernsback pioneered a kind of writing that combined hard technical description with an openness to the fantastic. It was a mixture out of which an entire literary genre emerged to tackle the question of the distinctive specificity of "medium" in a new wireless age in the opening decades of the twentieth century.  

This story has held sway over the reception of Gernsback until very recently.  Gernsback's life and works are now beginning to receive a more formal treatment as well, with two major museum exhibits recently held: one at Luxembourg's [National Center for Literature](http://www.cnl.public.lu/agenda/2011/5/Expo_Hugo_Gernsback/index.html?highlight=gernsback) in 2011, and another in 2013 at the [ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology)](http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader8492) in Karlsruhe, curated by Franz Pichler and the media theorist Peter Weibel.^[A video of this exhibit can be seen at <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEq6Mlu9j8I>.]  In addition, the visual artist Eric Schockmel is currently developing an animated documentary film about Gernsback.

Science fiction emerged in the United States as a discourse on media.

The incredibly rich context of the science fiction's birth in Gernsback's fleet of technical publications for the amateur experimenter, as well as his work as a pioneer in media technologies and broadcasting techniques, have been entirely overlooked.  In his illustrated magazines and compendiums of amateur designs, one could find a literary treatise on what the genre of "scientifiction" should look like alongside blueprints for a homebrewed television receiver well before its commercial possibility.  Gernsback's translation of an influential German handbook titled *The Practical Electrician* ran next to a speculative article on what it would take to provide a global system of free electricity powered by ocean currents.  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines used speculative fiction to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.

*The Perversity of Things* thus seeks to provide a reappraisal of both the "hard" technical roots of American science fiction and the highly speculative orientation toward media technologies that was prevalent during this period.  Science fiction in its early days wasn't just a literary form, it was a mode of interacting with and understanding new media.  The literary historical gambit of this book is to recover the radical sense of openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of "scientifiction" stories who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that "Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible."  Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.

This isn't the story of an Edison or a Jobs, inventors whose creations for better or worse have changed the way we inhabit the world.  Gernsback's career left us with a way of participating in that change, imagining its possible futures, and debating which future it is that we should live in.  This is the story of the development of a community, of a series of practices and a way of approaching the world.

* * * * * * * * * * 

What's really interesting is the community that these magazines represent. HG as a house editorial name. He's representative of a moment that falls between the gaps of literary and technological history, and his writings serve as the best introduction to that discourse.

notes

--------

	⁃	The gap between technical realities and narrative exposition, storyboarding, storytelling

	⁃	knowledge through one’s hands, through the nerves.  and not just knowledge, but understanding the future

	⁃	MAKE SURE that it's clear this is an argument not just about the emergence of SF, but an early media theory.  A discourse on media as it played out in everyday life that drew on applied forms of speculative science.

	⁃	The opening should be a condensation of the introduction, hitting all of the main points: SF as making, early media theory, speculative science

	⁃	But the need for this volume is now becoming apparent as we experience technological revolutions in the fabric of the everyday similar to those that brought readers to the Gernsback publications a century ago.  The ability of Gernsback's ideas to speak to us today can be seen in the ways that images from his magazines circulate online through a wide variety of social image sharing sites and blogs, like Reddit, Tumblr, and the Scientific American blog *Paleofuture*.
