It's the summer of 1906 in downtown Manhattan and Louis Coggeshall hovers over a bucket of dimes in the back room of the Electro Importing Company's retail store, filing them down to a coarse powder.  Sitting amid shelves of electrolytic detectors, circuit switches, ammeters, and Geissler tubes ready for sale to the city's growing community of amateur experimenters, he lets the metal filings fall into a small cardboard box at his feet.  Making a coherer, one of the earliest forms of radio receiver, required a certain amount of culinary improvisation in order to find the proportion of metals that would produce the strongest signal possible.  At the time, dimes were minted on ninety percent silver, so Coggeshall’s next steps were to mix the filings with the perfect ratio of iron powder and finally to pour that mixture into a small glass vial.[^mrc]  When a radio frequency wave comes into contact with this coherer, the metal filings cling together, allowing a signal to flow between electrodes connected to either end of the vial and, depending on how long the telegraph key on the transmitting end of that radio wave is depressed, produce a *dot* or a *dash* in Morse code.  Mounting this final element onto a wooden base dotted with other handmade components, Coggeshall completes the construction of another one of the Electro Importing Company's flagship products: the Telimco wireless telegraph set, a portmanteau of the company's name and one of the first fully-assembled radio sets ever sold to the American public.^[@_telimco_2002. @gernsback_50_1956.]

Coggeshall also did the cover art for the first issues of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog.  @gernsback_old_1938.

Meanwhile in the offices upstairs, the founder of Electro Importing Hugo Gernsback writes increasingly breathless advertising copy for the Telimco, promising it to be a means of professional success and economic mobility.  In one issue of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog*---a mail-in marketplace that provided access to "Everything for the Experimenter"---Gernsback claimed that with the Telimco, "We give you the opportunity to tick yourself up to the head of a future wireless telegraph company as did Marconi, De Forest and others."  Priced at $7.50, the set was an attractive proposition from a company who claimed to be "the largest makers of experimental Wireless Material in the world", requiring little more than a working knowledge of Morse code in order to get started.  First advertised in the November 25, 1905 issue of *Scientific American,* the Telimco appeared thereafter every two weeks, quickly becoming one of Electro Importing's best selling items.  In order to reach a wider public, Gernsback -- a twenty-one year old Jewish immigrant from Luxembourg who at that point had been in the United States for only two years -- visited retailers around the city like Macy’s, Gimbels, Marshall Field's, and FAO Schwartz, giving demonstrations of the device to incredulous salespeople who had no conceptual framework through which to understand “wireless.”  And for good reason: not only was wireless still in its infancy and largely unknown to the public, it was a technology whose successful transmission of information through the air wasn’t fully understood even by the scientific community.  From the physical substrate of metal filings to an entirely new means of communication that would soon be in every home, Gernsback and his colleagues were in the process of transubstantiating one medium into a medium of another kind.

This is the story of a literary genre's emergence.  But it is likely not one that the reader is familiar with.  Hugo Gernsback is remembered today as the founding editor of the first science fiction magazine, *Amazing Stories,* a large-format title printed on thick pulp paper that debuted on newsstands in April 1926.  *Amazing Stories* gave a name to fiction treating the speculative and the otherworldly through a systematically realist lens:  scientifiction.  And it established a forum for fans of the genre to debate and influence the future of its development.  In recognition of this legacy, Gernsback's name adorns the awards given out each year to the best works in the genre, the Hugo Awards, and many scholars use the launch of *Amazing Stories* in 1926 to date the invention of modern science fiction.  This book is devoted to the idea that the project of science fiction as Gernsback understood it in fact had its origins in an earlier context:  as a series of devices, debates, and visions shared by a community of tinkerers that formed around Gernsback's electrical supply shop and technology magazines.  Largely thanks to the iconographies and standardized plots codified by *Amazing Stories,* the term *science fiction* today conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, and starships.  But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before the accretion of a hundred years' worth of narratives, images, and clichés, that which was not yet called science fiction consisted of a number of concrete practices all geared toward a reckoning with technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life.  Before it was a particular kind of story or plot, science fiction was a way of thinking about and interacting with emerging media.[^sfsg]

[^sfsg]: I don't mean to give any priority to the "invention" of SF in the pulps over a deeper history of precursors in authors like Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne, even Johannes Kepler's *Somnium* (1608) or John Wilkins's *The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone* (1638).  Nor do I believe that the sociocultural complexities of texts like Samuel R. Delany's *Dhalgren* (1975) or Kathy Acker's *Empire of the Senseless* (1988) can be directly traced to the techno-utopian work published in *Amazing Stories.*  As Carl Freedman remarks, "current Anglo-American science fiction draws on far more than the pulp tradition that constitutes *one* of its filiations."  @freedman_critical_2000, 15.  

	Even though discussions of Gernsback tend to revolve around "firsts," largely due to his own claims, arguments about primacy and filiation are not my goal here.  Instead, what interests me is the idea that this period in the genre's history has been too quickly passed over and dismissed as simplistic and embarrassingly techno-utopian.  I would like to assess this work not as a "first" from which the entire genre proceeds (although, in many ways, it does), but as a unique moment in its history that not many people are familiar with.

![Electro Importing Company advertisement in *Modern Electrics* (1908).](images/christmas_suggestions.jpg)

What began with the *Electro Importing Catalog* and its miscellany of strange devices like the Telimco soon expanded into a number of companion magazines for the amateur tinkerer like *Modern Electrics* (first published in 1908), *Electrical Experimenter* (1913), and *Radio News* (1919).  In these richly illustrated magazines, one could find blueprints for a home-brewed television receiver (well before the technology was commercially feasible) alongside a literary treatise on how scientifiction stories should be structured.  Giving equal space to the soberly technical and the wildly utopian, Gernsback's translation of an influential German handbook titled *The Practical Electrician* ran next to a speculative article on what it would take to provide a global system of free electricity powered by ocean currents.  Each issue showcased designs submitted by readers, their own personal "wrinkles, recipes, and formulas" that would be taken up and debated by others through letters printed in the subsequent issues, much like the letter column in later science fiction magazines.  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines used speculative thought to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.  This selection of Gernsback's editorials, blueprints, literary critical essays, and media histories have been out of print since their original publication in these magazines from 1905-1933.  Together, they show how his publications evolved from an electrical parts catalog into a fully-fledged literary genre.  Not only is Gernsback a founding figure in the history of science fiction, but as the curator of a recent exhibit on Gernsback at the ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology), Franz Pichler writes, "Hugo Gernsback is the father of American electronic culture" in that he developed a means of describing and assessing the cultural impact of new media.^[@pichler_hugo_2013. Co-curated by Pichler and the media theorist Peter Weibel, this exhibit at the ZKM in Karlsruhe was one of two recent museum showcases of Gernsback's life and work.  The other was held at Luxembourg's National Center for Literature in 2011.  In addition, the visual artist Eric Schockmel is currently developing an animated documentary film about Gernsback.]

One of the challenges in recovering an understanding of science fiction *avant la lettre* is the fact that many of the variables its stories revolve around -- science, media, and technology -- the very subjects and objects of science fiction, were concepts still in flux.  Science as it was understood in the public sphere was a highly variable entity, and had no settled explanations for the technical accomplishments in emerging media like wireless telegraphy, for example.  Wireless telegraphy wouldn't be referred to or understood as a *medium* for several decades, and even the term *technology* itself wasn't used in the American English vernacular until the 1930s, as we will see later.  The essays that follow, therefore, represent a media theory in the making, in which *media* are addressed not primarily as mass-cultural forms like cinema or television news, but as the affordances of and possibilities inherent in the smallest individual components:  the selenium-coated plate, the tungsten lamp, the chromic plunge battery.  In his monthly editorials, feature articles, and short fiction, Gernsback pioneered a kind of writing that combined hard technical description with an openness to the fantastic.  It's perhaps this penchant in his work to dwell in the extremes of both technical detail and fantastic speculation that accounts for Gernsback's absence in the pages of both science fiction studies and the history of technology.  For one community, he is too obsessed with material details and merely produces what are dismissively referred to as "gadget stories."  For the other, his inventions and technical writings are never able to back up their promises, being far too concerned with future contingencies to merit serious attention.  But it's precisely the novel coexistence of these diametrically opposed modes throughout Gernsback's work -- radically practical and radically speculative -- that led to the explosive popularity of his ideas in several different forums.  Across the thirty year period covered by this book, you will find technical precision and fantastic speculation in different proportions, and articles that toggle from one extreme of this spectrum to the other with varying effects.  The writings that begin with engineering specifications don't take long to spin out into wondrous possibilities, but those futures always proceed from miniscule details.  Using interleaving descriptive and narrative frameworks to describe a particular device, experience, or vision of the future, Gernsback followed the smallest of technological developments through to their most logical, and sometimes extreme, conclusions:  the increased availability of a light-sensitive alloy implied that the coming of visual telephones was near, and the number of amateurs sending in their own designs for primitive television receivers only served to confirm the immanence of this new mode of communication.

![Gernsback presenting a replica of the Telimco to the Henry Ford Museum, 1957.](images/gernsback_ford_museum.jpg)  [[NOT THE RIGHT IMAGE]]

The Telimco, for instance, was not exactly the revolutionary device that first brought radio to the masses Gernsback later liked to claim it was.  Though its advertisements claimed the set was "guaranteed to work up to one mile," the Telimco was notoriously finicky.^[@_wireless_1905]  As it was sold, the outfit had a range of merely 300-500 feet and could only receive signals from further distances when a large antenna was hooked up.  Further, it was highly susceptible to any kind of electrical interference, such as the elevator motor in the Electro Importing Company building, which caused difficulties during in-store demonstrations of the apparatus.  The Telimco's untuned circuits, which would produce a high degree of interference for any nearby radio station, would soon be outlawed by federal legislation.  For these reasons, its metal filings coherers "had all but disappeared from commercial work in 1910" according to historian of early radio Thomas White.^[@white_pioneering_1996]  From this perspective, the Telimco seems less a practical means of communication than a proof of concept for a growing group of "electrics" hobbyists.  (A similar tone can be found in **The Radioson Detector** and **The Physiophone**.)  In essence, it was little more than a gimmick, a parlor trick: press a button and a bell in another room would ring without the need for any intervening wires.  This didn't stop Gernsback from publishing instructions in 1908 on connecting a telephone mouthpiece to the transmitting end of the Telimco and an engine to the receiving end, so that the "power" of the human voice could be used to start that engine (**The Dynamophone**).  Or in the following year, describing how thousands of perfectly synchronized home wireless sets would be capable of sending a message to the aliens that surely must be listening for us on Mars (**Signaling to Mars**).  Or months later, laying out in great technical detail how it would be possible to send and receive motion pictures over the airwaves using currently available equipment (**Television and the Telephot**).  

The Telimco was one of countless artifacts profiled in the Gernsback magazines that blurred the lines between the real and the imaginary.  While some were awarded patents and others were available for sale, others seem more like branding exercises or rallying calls for a community of active amateur experimenters to run with the as-of-yet unrealizable idea.  More often than not, these above categories bleed into one another.  Gernsback gave names to these ideas like the Aerophone (a name for wireless audio transmission, rather than merely telegraphic code), the Telephot (an early conceptualization of the videophone), and the Hypnobioscope (an automated thought transcription and playback machine).  These gadgets appeared so frequently and in such diverse contexts -- as props in short stories, as homemade designs in letters to the editor, as profiles of similar developments across Europe -- that one gets the sense paging through the magazines that they are all part of a coherent fictional world, built up across many years and many issues.  Given the pace of technological change in the early twentieth century, it seemed as if any one element of this fictional world could bleed into everyday life at any moment.

Another category of Gernsback's essays proceed along the spectrum in the opposite direction:  from research in some highly speculative science to its potential applications in consumer technologies.  By this point the American magazine reading public was familiar with the idiom of popular science reportage.  While nineteenth-century scientific periodicals in the United States took the form of highly specialized *Proceedings* or *Transactions* or *Reports* of professional research groups, the *fin de siécle* saw a proliferation of titles aimed at a much broader audience.  *Scientific American* for instance, the best known of these publications and one that still runs today, attracted a readership that included credentialed researchers, industrial manufacturers, an interested general public, as well as a "nebulous community of inventors (ranging from the local tinkerer to manufacturer and professional inventor/technologist)."  Science in these new magazines was made accessible to a growing number of readers seeking to educate themselves or simply desiring to remain informed about recent developments.[^psci]  But while Gernsback's magazines may seem familiar to us today through their progeny such as *Wired,* *Popular Science,* and *Popular Mechanics* (the latter two of which are the direct successors to Gernsback titles) in many ways they bear more in common with a deeper tradition of popular science that blurred the lines between illusion and truth, skepticism and belief.  From medieval displays of the natural world's wondrous curiosities to nineteenth-century phantasmagoria and other audiovisual spectacles, "the positive sciences and the fantastic arts [have been] linked in a dialectic of doubt and certainty."^[@tresch_prophet_2011; @daston_wonders_1998; @andriopoulos_ghostly_2013.]  Unseen forces were at work in the miracle of wireless telegraphy, a literally unbelievable technology that meant disembodied thoughts from around the world could be skimmed from the air in the comfort of your home.  If this miracle were possible, what else might be?

[^psci]: @whalen_periodicals_1980.  For a history of the view that a scientifically educated public was an imperative for American democracy in the early twentieth century, a period during which the concept of "science" itself was in flux, see @jewett_science_2014, especially Chapters 4 and 7.

For Gernsback and his staff, rapid advances in technology made the speculative sciences of antigravitation and "thought waves" seem within reach.  From a belief in the presence of the luminiferous ether, to an argument that gravity is an electrical phenomenon, to the suggestion that humans may be able to tap into the so-called sixth senses of animals, or that the earth's core is made of radium and drives recurring cycles of life's evolution, certain Gernsback titles reveled in the scandalous yet somehow strangely intuitive realms of scientific speculation.^[@gernsback_ether_1916; @gernsback_gravitation_1918; @gernsback_unknown_1920; @gernsback_radium_1916]  The Gernsback magazines and their competitors like *The Wireless Age, QST,* and *Popular Science Monthly* were gradually opening up the specialist orientation of the sciences to a wider public who had a lot of questions, if only because the products of science were increasingly a part of everyday life.  "As time goes on it becomes more apparent that our senses are becoming more and more involved directly due to scientific progress."  With the reproduction of artificial sounds, images, scents, even the illusion of motion itself in carnival rides, "We should never trust our senses too much in these latter days of scientific progress."^[@gernsback_modern_1927.]  What set the Gernsback titles apart was not only their willingness to tackle fantastic topics that these other publications wouldn't, but to do so through the lens of hands-on technical know-how and the argument that knowledge comes through making.  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog* seemed -- solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes -- Gernsback and his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appeared as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one could pick and choose from of the pages of the *Catalog.*  And for the more long-term projections like thought wave recorders and videophones, they were described as handicraft futures that would come to pass with just a little more tinkering.

The behavioral archaeologist and historian of radio Michael Schiffer refers to Gernsback and his writers as "techno-mancers" in that their stories about wide ranging and marvelous technological futures as well as specific devices like pocket-sized radios and color television created a "cultural imperative" for inventors, engineers, and scientists alike to bring them about.^[@schiffer_portable_1991, 136]  What this account misses is that this exchange between visions and their execution happened in the pages of these magazines themselves…

These handicraft futures seemed so seductive because they were futures that you, the reader, could build yourself.

At work here is a certain form of magic, when we don’t know how something works but we can see that, plainly, it does (see Mauss).  Our suspicion is elicited, nonetheless.  It’s also a form of advertising rhetoric, a hucksterism to sell more sets.  A more charitable version of this would say that HG was out to build a genuine community of practice around building, tinkering, and communicating through this new medium in the making.  But this is also about prototyping the future — understanding what the future will be like, setting up the conditions in which we can assess and critique its coming, with ready to hand, available material objects.  "Beauty is a groping of the emotions towards realization of things which may be unknown only to the intellect" (**Fiction Versus Facts**).  

A faith in the future and technoscientific progress that remains remarkably unscathed in the wake of the First World War, in a way that only an American technologist could be.  

"…we do not define magic in terms of the structure of its rites, but by the circumstances in which the rites occur, which in turn determine the place they occupy in the totality of social customs." (30)

The traditional character of magic is "bound up with the arts and crafts.  The successive gestures of an artisan may be as uniformly regulated as those of a magician."  (24)

But in magic, "it is not really believed that the gestures themselves bring about the result.  The effect derives from something else, and usually this is not of the same order."  Technique, on the other hand, maintains a "homogeneity between cause and effect."  "Everyone knows that the results are achieved directly through the co-ordination of action, tool and physical agent." (25)

While people like Tesla had already established the fact that invention was part of an entire discursive network of speculations, projections, etc., Gernsback was able to popularize these forms of using technology.  His work is all about amateurs thinking in the same way, and everyday people feeling this amazement as they use technology, not as dumb spectators with their minds blown by the magician Tesla, but as active participants.  Which actually makes him an interesting figure in Lori Emerson's argument that technology today (Apple especially) has become too magical.  Gernsback, especially in his writings on "spritism", was totally against magic.  Let's get our hands dirty with this technology, *while* we appreciate at the same time exactly how "amazing" it is.

This is what Gernsback called “the perversity of things,” or the innate capacity of objects to elicit unique responses in users, skilled or novice.  (briefly introduce)

Titled after an essay of his on the influence that objects exert on thought, *The Perversity of Things: Writings on Media, Technology, and Science Fiction* makes available texts by Gernsback that were foundational for both science fiction and the emergence of media studies.  

*The Perversity of Things* thus seeks to provide a reappraisal of both the "hard" technical roots of American science fiction and the highly speculative orientation toward media technologies that was prevalent during this period.  Science fiction in its early days wasn't just a literary form, it was a mode of interacting with and understanding new media.  The literary historical gambit of this book is to recover the radical sense of openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of "scientifiction" stories who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that "Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible" (**A New Sort of Magazine**).  Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.

This isn't the story of an Edison or a Jobs, inventors whose creations for better or worse have changed the way we inhabit the world.  Gernsback's career left us with a way of participating in that change, imagining its possible futures, and debating which future it is that we should live in.  This is the story of the development of a community, of a series of practices and a way of approaching the world.

What's really interesting is the community that these magazines represent, less than HG as a person. HG as a house editorial name. He's representative of a moment that falls between the gaps of literary and technological history, and his writings serve as the best introduction to that discourse.

The essays that follow are representative of a discussion among overlapping publics that sometimes explicitly occluded certain groups and at others offered a way in for the otherwise occluded voices of women and, in the argument of Steve Silberman, allowed people on the Autism spectrum to 

> Both amateur radio and science fiction fandom offered ways of gaining social recognition outside traditional channels. . . . For people who found open-ended conversations daunting, the byzantine customs and rituals of fandom furnished reassuring scripts for interaction. 

> By routing around the face-to-face interactions they found so daunting, even people who found it nearly impossible to communicate through speech were able to reach out to kindred spirits, find potential mentors, and gain the skills and confidence they needed to become productive members of society.^[@silberman_neurotribes:_2015]

But the need for this volume is now becoming apparent as we experience technological revolutions in the fabric of the everyday similar to those that brought readers to the Gernsback publications a century ago.  The ability of Gernsback's ideas to speak to us today can be seen in the ways that images from his magazines circulate online through a wide variety of social image sharing sites and blogs, like Reddit, Tumblr, and the Scientific American blog *Paleofuture*.

and later, in *Sexology* (1933), a relatively progressive treatment of masturbation, homosexuality, and premarital sex into the 1950s and 60s, although articles on "breastfeeding fathers, women with extra breasts, Hitler's sex life, [and] rubber fetishism" were more common.^[Though it's outside the scope of this volume, for a selection of articles from this magazine see @yoe_best_2008.]
