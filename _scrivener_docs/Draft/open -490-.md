It's the summer of 1906 in downtown Manhattan and Louis Coggeshall hovers over a bucket of dimes in the back room of the Electro Importing Company's retail store, filing them down to a coarse powder.  Sitting amid shelves of electrolytic detectors, circuit switches, ammeters, and Geissler tubes ready for sale to the city's growing community of amateur experimenters, he lets the metal filings fall into a small cardboard box at his feet.  Making a coherer, one of the earliest forms of radio receiver, required a certain amount of culinary improvisation in order to find the proportion of metals that would produce the strongest signal possible.  At the time, dimes were minted on ninety percent silver, so Coggeshall’s next steps were to mix the filings with the perfect ratio of iron powder and finally to pour that mixture into a small glass vial.[^mrc]  When a radio frequency wave comes into contact with this coherer, the metal filings cling together, allowing a signal to flow between electrodes connected to either end of the vial and, depending on how long the telegraph key on the transmitting end of that radio wave is depressed, produce a *dot* or a *dash* in Morse code.  Mounting this final element onto a wooden base dotted with other handmade components, Coggeshall completes the construction of another one of the Electro Importing Company's flagship products: the Telimco wireless telegraph set, a portmanteau of the company's name and one of the first fully-assembled radio sets ever sold to the American public.^[@_telimco_2002. @gernsback_50_1956.]

Coggeshall also did the cover art for the first issues of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog.  @gernsback_old_1938.

Meanwhile in the offices upstairs, the founder of Electro Importing Hugo Gernsback writes increasingly breathless advertising copy for the Telimco, promising it to be a means of professional success and upward mobility.  In one issue of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog*---a mail-in marketplace that provided access to "Everything for the Experimenter"---Gernsback claimed that with the Telimco, "We give you the opportunity to tick yourself up to the head of a future wireless telegraph company as did Marconi, De Forest and others."  Priced at $7.50, the set was an attractive proposition from a company who claimed to be "the largest makers of experimental Wireless Material in the world", requiring little more than a working knowledge of Morse code in order to get started.  First advertised in the November 25, 1905 issue of *Scientific American,* the Telimco appeared thereafter every two weeks, quickly becoming one of Electro Importing's best selling items.  In order to reach a wider public, Gernsback---a twenty-one year old Jewish immigrant from Luxembourg who at that point had been in the United States for only two years---visited retailers around the city like Macy’s, Gimbels, Marshall Field's, and FAO Schwartz, giving demonstrations of the device to incredulous salespeople who had no conceptual framework through which to understand “wireless.”  And for good reason: not only was wireless still in its infancy and largely unknown to the public, it was a technology whose successful transmission of information through the air wasn’t fully understood even by the scientific community.  From the physical substrate of metal filings to an entirely new means of communication that would soon be in every home, Gernsback and his colleagues were in the process of transubstantiating one medium into a medium of another kind.

This is the story of a literary genre's emergence.  But it is likely not one that the reader is familiar with.  Hugo Gernsback is remembered today as the founding editor of the first science fiction magazine, *Amazing Stories,* a large-format title printed on thick pulp paper that debuted on newsstands in early March 1926.  *Amazing Stories* gave a name to fiction treating the speculative and the otherworldly through a systematically realist lens:  scientifiction.  And it established a forum for fans of the genre to debate and influence the future of its development.  In recognition of this legacy, Gernsback's name adorns the awards given out each year to the best works in the genre, the Hugo Awards, and many scholars use the launch of *Amazing Stories* in 1926 to date the invention of modern science fiction.  This book is devoted to the idea that the project of science fiction as Gernsback understood it in fact had its origins in an earlier context:  as a series of interlinking devices, debates, and visions shared by a community of tinkerers that formed around Gernsback's electrical supply shop and technology magazines.  Largely thanks to the iconographies and standardized plots codified by *Amazing Stories,* the term *science fiction* today conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, and starships.  But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before the accretion of a hundred years' worth of narratives, images, and clichés, that which was not yet called science fiction consisted of a number of concrete practices all geared toward a reckoning with technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life.  Before it was a particular kind of story or plot, science fiction was a way of thinking about and interacting with emerging media.

![Electro Importing Company advertisement in *Modern Electrics* (1908).](images/christmas_suggestions.jpg)

What began with the *Electro Importing Catalog* and its miscellany of strange devices like the Telimco soon expanded into a number of companion magazines for the amateur tinkerer like *Modern Electrics* (first published in 1908), *Electrical Experimenter* (1913), and *Radio News* (1919).  In these richly illustrated magazines, one could find blueprints for a home-brewed television receiver (well before the technology was feasible) alongside a literary treatise on how scientifiction stories should be structured.  Giving equal space to the soberly technical and the wildly utopian meant that Gernsback's translation of an influential German handbook titled *The Practical Electrician,* for instance, could run alongside a speculative article on what it would take to provide a global system of free electricity powered by ocean currents.  Each issue showcased designs submitted by readers, their own personal "wrinkles, recipes, and formulas" that would be taken up and debated by others through letters printed in subsequent issues, much like the famous letter column in later science fiction magazines.^[For a history of science fiction fandom and what Samuel R. Delany calls "the vast tributary system of informal criticism," see @moskowitz_immortal_1974.]  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines and their readers used speculative thought to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.  While Gernsback for better or worse has been enshrined as science fiction's founding figure (fans refer to him as "Uncle Hugo"), less well known are the ways in which he is "the father of American electronic culture," in the words of Franz Pichler, curator of a recent exhibit on Gernsback at the ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology).[^bwbp]  In order to come to terms with the place from which both of these nascent discourses emerged, scientifiction and media culture, we have to see them as part of a continuum.

[^bwbp]:  Co-curated by Pichler and the media theorist Peter Weibel, this exhibit at the ZKM in Karlsruhe was one of two recent museum showcases of Gernsback's life and work.  The other was held at Luxembourg's National Center for Literature in 2011.  @pichler_hugo_2013.

One of the challenges in recovering an understanding of science fiction *avant la lettre* is the fact that many of the variables its stories revolve around---science, media, and technology---the very subjects and objects of scientifiction, were concepts still very much in flux.  Science as it was understood in the public sphere was a highly variable entity, and had no settled explanations for the accomplishments of new technologies like wireless telegraphy.  These technical media were only just beginning to be understood as *media* in the modern sense of mass communications, and even the term *technology* itself wasn't used in the American English vernacular until the 1920s, as we will see later.^[@guillory_genesis_2010. @marx_technology:_2010.]  The essays that follow, therefore, represent a media theory in the making, in which *media* are addressed not primarily as mass-cultural forms like cinema or television programming, but as the affordances of and possibilities inherent in the smallest individual components:  the selenium-coated plate, the tungsten lamp, the chromic plunge battery.  In his monthly editorials, feature articles, and short fiction, Gernsback pioneered a kind of writing that combined hard technical description with an openness to the fantastic.  Using interleaving descriptive and narrative frameworks to describe a particular device, experience, or vision of the future, Gernsback followed the smallest of technological developments through to their most logical, and sometimes extreme, conclusions:  the increased availability of a light-sensitive alloy implied that the coming of visual telephones was near, and the number of amateurs sending in their own designs for primitive television receivers only served to confirm the immanence of this new mode of communication.

Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of *Modern Electrics* and *Electrical Experimenter* seemed---solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes---Gernsback and his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appeared as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one could pick and choose from of the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog.*  Even the long-term projections like thought wave recorders and videophones were described as handicraft futures that would come to pass with just a little more tinkering.  As Samuel R. Delany writes,

> The new American SF took on the practically incantatory task of naming nonexistent objects, then investing them with reality by a host of methods, technological and pseudotechnological explanations, embedding them in dramatic situations, or just inculcating them by pure repetition.^[@delany_critical_2009.]

These gadgets appeared so frequently and in such diverse contexts---as props in short stories, as homemade designs in letters to the editor, as profiles of similar developments across Europe---that one gets the sense paging through the magazines that they are all part of a coherent fictional world, built up across many years and many issues.  Given the pace of technological change in the early twentieth century, it seemed as if any one element of this fictional world could bleed into everyday life at any moment.

It's perhaps this penchant in his work to dwell in the extremes of both technical detail and fantastic speculation that accounts for Gernsback's absence in the pages of science fiction studies and the history of technology.  For the former, he is too obsessed with material details and as an editor and writer merely produces stylistically bland lists of technological marvels, what are dismissively referred to as "gadget stories."  For historians of technology, Gernsback's inventions and technical writings are never able to back up their promises, being far too concerned with future contingencies to merit serious attention.  But it's precisely the novel coexistence of these diametrically opposed modes throughout Gernsback's work---radically practical and radically speculative---that led to the explosive popularity of his ideas in several different forums.  Across the thirty year period covered by this book, the reader will find technical precision and utopian speculation in varying proportions, and articles that toggle from one end of this spectrum to the other with ease.

By this point the American magazine reading public was familiar with the idiom of popular science reportage.  While nineteenth-century scientific periodicals in the United States took the form of highly specialized *Proceedings* or *Transactions* or *Reports* of academic research organizations, the *fin de siécle* saw a proliferation of titles aimed at a much broader audience.  *Scientific American* for instance, the best known of these publications and one that still runs today, attracted a readership that included credentialed researchers, industrial manufacturers, an interested general public, as well as a "nebulous community of inventors (ranging from the local tinkerer to manufacturer and professional inventor/technologist)."  Science in these new magazines was made accessible to a growing number of readers seeking to educate themselves or simply desiring to remain informed about recent developments.[^psci]  But while Gernsback's magazines may seem familiar to us today through their progeny such as *Wired,* *Popular Science,* and *Popular Mechanics* (the latter two of which are the direct successors to Gernsback titles through mergers and acquisitions) in many ways they bear more in common with a deeper tradition of popular science that blurred the lines between illusion and truth, skepticism and belief.  As many historians of science have recently shown, from medieval displays of the natural world's wondrous curiosities to nineteenth-century phantasmagoria and other audiovisual spectacles, "the positive sciences and the fantastic arts [have been] linked in a dialectic of doubt and certainty."^[@tresch_prophet_2011; @daston_wonders_1998; @andriopoulos_ghostly_2013.]  Unseen forces were at work in the miracle of wireless telegraphy, a literally unbelievable technology that meant disembodied thoughts from around the world could be skimmed from the air in the comfort of your home.  If this miracle were possible, what else might be?

[^psci]:  @whalen_periodicals_1980.  For a history of the view that a scientifically educated public was an imperative for American democracy in the early twentieth century, a period during which the concept of "science" itself was being determined largely by secondary school curricula, see @jewett_science_2014, especially Chapters 4 and 7.

For Gernsback and his staff, rapid developments in the electrical arts made the speculative sciences of antigravitation and "thought waves" seem within reach.  From a belief in the presence of the luminiferous ether, to an argument that gravity is an electrical phenomenon, to the suggestion that humans may be able to tap into the so-called sixth senses of animals, or that the earth's core is made of radium and drives recurring cycles of life's evolution, Gernsback's purportedly "scientific" titles reveled in the fantastic.^[@gernsback_ether_1916; @gernsback_gravitation_1918; @gernsback_unknown_1920; @gernsback_radium_1916]  And while competing magazines like *The Wireless Age, QST,* and *Popular Science Monthly* were gradually opening up the specialist orientation of the sciences to a wider public through sober reportage, Gernsback addressed a growing readership who found the products of science to increasingly form a bewildering part of their everyday lives, addressing them from this perspective.  "As time goes on it becomes more apparent that our senses are becoming more and more involved directly due to scientific progress," he wrote.  Listing a miscellany of sensory illusions that had become commonplace, from "blazing names being written out in the night sky" by moving electric signs, to the "radio illusion" of reproduced sound, to the simulated effects of motion in new carnival rides, Gernsback warns that "We should never trust our senses too much in these latter days of scientific progress."^[@gernsback_modern_1927.]  Given the rate of this "progress," the reader should not be surprised if the next great scientific advance, seemingly impossible today, should become commonplace tomorrow.  As we will see over the course of Gernsback's writings, this almost spiritual faith in technoscientific progress remains remarkably unscathed in the wake of the First World War and the Depression, a faith that only an American technologist could claim, at a remove from the horrors of the trenches and doubling down with the idea that cultural welfare could be technocratically managed by machines and their engineers (**Human Progress; Wonders of the Machine Age**).  "Progress in science is as infinite as time, it is inconvceivable how either would stop" (**Imagination Versus Facts**).

But for Gernsback, projections of the future or progress and its wonders were never simply bewildering.  They were the occasion for a material education in the way things worked.  As a reader of and contributor to *Amazing Stories,* G. Peyton Wertenbaker, wrote in a letter to the editor, in characteristically pulp prose, "Beauty is a groping of the emotions towards realization of things which may be unknown only to the intellect" (**Fiction Versus Facts**).  The behavioral archaeologist and historian of radio Michael Schiffer refers to Gernsback and his writers as "techno-mancers," arguing that their depictions of wide-ranging futures created a "cultural imperative" for inventors, engineers, and scientists to make these dreams a reality.^[@schiffer_portable_1991, 136]  And in a sense, this is true, with many speculative ideas as described by Gernsback retrospectively seeming like "predictions" of modern technologies (**Television and the Telephot; What to Invent; Predicting Future Inventions**).  But what makes sense as a neat, two-step model for literature as a source of inspiration and invention was actually a much messier process in practice, like a melody played so fast that the notes become indistinguishable.[^sfvt]  The Gernsback titles were unique in their willingness to tackle fantastic topics that other publications wouldn't, and did so through the lens of hands-on technical know-how.  Behind the gadgets of **Ralph 124C 41+,** Gernsback's famous serial novel of 1911, was a marketplace of evocative objects, a forum for amateurs experimenting with these strange new things, and an emerging consensus vision of their possible applications.  Over the course of long-running serial novels and the exchange of reader correspondence, the material basis of scientifiction's marvelous futures was gradually refined.

[^sfvt]: This two-part model of invention forms a common thread in science fiction criticism, with the genre providing a thinktank of sorts in magazines, novels, and films, continuously replenishing a reservoir of ideas for technologists to draw upon in their own inventive process.  See for instance @disch_dreams_1998;  @shedroff_make_2012.

This book won't offer an answer to tired arguments over whether science fiction had its origins in the pulps or is best considered in relation to a deeper tradition of precursors by Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne, even John Wilkins's *The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone* (1638) or Thomas More's *Utopia* (1516).  Returning to the works of Hugo Gernsback is of course not meant to suggest that the cultural, sexual, and ecological complexities of novels like Samuel R. Delany's *Dhalgren* (1975), Kathy Acker's *Empire of the Senseless* (1988), or Paolo Bacigalupi's *The Windup Girl* (2009) can be directly traced to the techno-utopian texts first published in *Amazing Stories.*  As Carl Freedman writes, "current Anglo-American science fiction draws on far more than the pulp tradition that constitutes *one* of its filiations."^[@freedman_critical_2000, p. 15.]  *The Perversity of Things* instead takes seriously Delany's idea that science fiction and literature are two entirely separate cultural forms.  In order to fully understand "a tradition of writers who considered themselves craftsmen first and artists secondarily, if at all," we have to move beyond literary critical frameworks that are entirely unsuited to thinking about craft, materiality, and collective practice.^[@delany_silent_1994, p. 200.]  Gernsback's handicraft futures seemed so seductive because they were futures that you, the reader, could build yourself.  With practice and experience, the reader of these magazines could pick up any object and sense its affordances, or what Gernsback called “the perversity of things.”  In other words, objects exert an influence on thought, eliciting unique responses in skilled and novice users alike.  It was Gernsback's lifelong project to educate a public in the tenets of science and technology so that they might contribute to an iterative process of making within what the American pragmatists referred to as a community of inquiry.

The prevailing approach in science fiction studies has been to dismiss the Gernsback magazines as embarrassingly simplistic, tasteless, and even detrimental to the eventual emergence of a mature literature.  This casual judgment of a Jewish immigrant who throughout his life was in search of a respectability as a technologist and editor that always seemed to elude him is ironic.^[For a history of the relationship between Jewish identity and science fiction, see @fingeroth_disguised_2009.]  A certain tone seems to have been set early on by the spectacularly racist H.P. Lovecraft's monicker for Gernsback: "Hugo the Rat."  The overwhelming attention that science fiction critics, to this day, give to the low rates he paid his writers (a common source of tension between *all* pulp writers and their editors) is unfortunate, and their misplaced derision of Gernsback's literary quality often carries with it an explicit disgust at his perceived character.[^asmt]  One can be forgiven for questioning the singular focus given to bankruptcy proceedings, profits, and wages in works of literary historical scholarship.  In the meantime, entirely overlooked has been the way that the overlapping publics attracted to Gernsback's magazines opened a space for voices that were otherwise explicitly occluded from public discourse.  As Steve Silberman has shown, "Both amateur radio and science fiction fandom offered ways of gaining social recognition outside traditional channels."^[@silberman_neurotribes:_2015.]  These magazines promised a populist education in new scientific and technical principles that would offer social inroads for wage laborers hoping to secure middle class careers, women who took advantage of the anonymity of Morse code and the power to reach an audience of countless listeners from home, as well as those "who found it nearly impossible to communicate through speech," a neurological condition we might associate today with autism.

[^asmt]: For Brian Stableford, Gernsback's "cowardly" launch of *Amazing Stories* was "purely a commercial adventure, which Gernsback undertook because he thought his existing subscription lists might help establish a secure commercial base for such a magazine."  @stableford_creators_1997.  Malcolm J. Edwards argues that Gernsback “bestowed upon his creation provincial dogmatism and an illiteracy that bedeviled US SF for years."  @clute_gernsback_1995, p. 491.  Richard Bleiler sees him as "a disastrous (if not a pernicious) figure, a man whose stultifying vision and lack of literary taste led to the establishment of a literature that for too many years was considered a laughingstock, that emphasized other elements than literary quality, and, perhaps worse [sic] of all, that paid the majority of its writers badly."  @grossman_hugo_2011.

*The Perversity of Things* thus seeks to provide a reappraisal of the "hard" technical roots of American science fiction, the highly speculative orientation toward media technologies that was prevalent during this period, as well as the communities that participated in the emergence of new technological media.  Science fiction in its early days wasn't just a literary form, it was a mode of interacting with and understanding new media.  The literary historical gambit of this book is to recover the radical sense of openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of scientifiction stories who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that "Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible" (**A New Sort of Magazine**).  Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.  This isn't the story of an Edison or a Jobs, inventors whose creations for better or worse have changed the way we inhabit the world.  Gernsback's career left us with a way of participating in that change, imagining its possible futures, and debating which future it is that we should live in.  This is the story of the development of a community, of a series of practices and a way of approaching the technologized world.
