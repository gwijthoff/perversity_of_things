It's the summer of 1906 in downtown Manhattan and Louis Coggeshall hovers over a bucket of dimes in the back room of the Electro Importing Company's retail store, filing them down to a coarse powder.  Sitting amid shelves of electrolytic detectors, circuit switches, ammeters, and Geissler tubes ready for sale to the city's growing community of amateur experimenters, he lets the metal filings fall into a small cardboard box at his feet.  Making a coherer, one of the earliest forms of radio receiver, required a certain amount of alchemical improvisation in order to find the proportion of metals that would produce the strongest signal possible.  At the time, dimes were minted on ninety percent silver, so Coggeshall next began to mix the filings with the perfect ratio of iron powder and finally to pour that mixture into a small glass vial.[^mrc]  When a radio frequency wave comes into contact with this coherer, the metal filings cling together, allowing a signal to flow between electrodes connected to either end of the vial.  Depending on how long the telegraph key on the transmitting end of that radio wave is depressed, the signal produces a *dot* or a *dash* in Morse code.  Mounting this final element onto a wooden base dotted with other handmade components, Coggeshall completes the construction of another one of the Electro Importing Company's flagship products: the Telimco wireless telegraph set, one of the first fully-assembled radios ever sold to the American public.^["Telimco" is a portmanteau of The Electro Importing Company.  @_telimco_2002. @gernsback_50_1956.]

[^mrc]:  Marconi's original "recipe" for the coherer called for one part silver to nineteen parts nickel (as opposed to iron).  @lee_nonlinear_2004, p. 4.  Coggeshall, who began his career as a telegraph operator for the Erie Railroad, first met Gernsback at a boardinghouse on 14th Street where they were both staying.  @moskowitz_explorers_1963, 231.  Coggeshall also did the cover art for the first issues of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog.*  @gernsback_old_1938.

Meanwhile in the offices upstairs, the founder of Electro Importing, Hugo Gernsback, writes increasingly breathless advertising copy for the Telimco, promising it to be a means of upward mobility.  In one issue of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog*---a mail-in marketplace that provided access to "Everything for the Experimenter"---Gernsback claimed that with the Telimco, "We give you the opportunity to tick yourself up to the head of a future wireless telegraph company as did Marconi, De Forest and others."  Priced at $7.50, the set was an attractive proposition from a company that claimed to be "the largest makers of experimental Wireless Material in the world," requiring little more than a working knowledge of Morse code in order to get started.  First advertised in the November 25, 1905 issue of *Scientific American,* the Telimco appeared thereafter every two weeks, quickly becoming one of Electro Importing's best selling items.  In order to reach a wider public, Gernsback---a twenty-one-year-old Jewish immigrant from Luxembourg who at that point had been in the United States for only two years---visited retailers around the city like Macy’s, Gimbels, Marshall Field's, and FAO Schwartz, giving demonstrations of the device to incredulous salespeople who had no conceptual framework by which to understand “wireless.”  And for good reason: not only was wireless still in its infancy and largely unknown to the public, it was a technology whose successful transmission of information through the air wasn’t fully understood even by the scientific community.  From the physical substrate of metal filings to an entirely new concept of communication that would soon be in every home, Gernsback and his colleagues were in the process of transmuting one medium into a medium of another kind.

*The Perversity of Things* is the story of a literary genre's emergence.  But it is likely not one that the reader is familiar with.  Hugo Gernsback is remembered today as the founding editor of the first science fiction magazine, *Amazing Stories,* a large-format title printed on thick pulp paper that debuted on newsstands in early March 1926.  *Amazing Stories* gave a name to fiction treating the speculative and the otherworldly through the lens of systematic realism:  scientifiction.^[An early abbreviation for scientifiction among fans was *stf,* pronounced *stef.*  Good stories were described with the adjective *st(e)fnal* and devoted fans were *st(e)fnists.*  See the fanzine edited by @eney_fancyclopedia_1959. Available online at http://fancyclopedia.wikidot.com/stf.]  And it established a forum for fans of the genre to debate and influence the future of its development.  In recognition of this legacy, Gernsback's name adorns the awards given out each year to the best works in the genre, the Hugo Awards.  Many scholars use the launch of *Amazing Stories* in 1926 to date the invention of modern science fiction.  

This book is devoted to the idea that the project of science fiction as Gernsback understood it in fact had its origins in an earlier context:  as a series of interlinking devices, debates, and visions shared by a community of tinkerers that formed around Gernsback's electrical supply shop and technology magazines.  Largely thanks to the iconography and standardized plots codified by *Amazing Stories,* the term "science fiction" today conjures up images of bug-eyed monsters, ray guns, and starships.  But in the opening decades of the twentieth century, before the accretion of a hundred years' worth of narratives, images, and clichés, that which was not yet called "science fiction" consisted of a number of concrete practices all geared toward reckoning with technological revolutions in the fabric of everyday life.  Before it was a particular kind of story or plot, science fiction was a way of thinking about and interacting with emerging media.

[INSERT FIGURE 0.2 NEAR HERE]

What began with the *Electro Importing Catalog* and its miscellany of strange devices like the Telimco soon expanded into a number of companion periodicals for the amateur tinkerer like *Modern Electrics* (first published in 1908), *Electrical Experimenter* (1913), and *Radio News* (1919).  In these richly illustrated magazines, one could find blueprints for a home-brewed television receiver (well before the technology was feasible) alongside a literary treatise on how scientifiction stories should be structured.  Giving equal space to the soberly technical and the wildly utopian meant that Gernsback's translation of an influential German handbook titled *The Practical Electrician,* for instance, could run alongside a speculative article on what it would take to provide a global system of free electricity powered by ocean currents.  Each issue showcased designs submitted by readers, their own personal "wrinkles, recipes, and formulas," that would be taken up and debated by others through letters printed in subsequent issues, much like the famous letter section in later science fiction magazines.^[For a history of the science fiction fandom that has constituted what Samuel R. Delany calls a "vast tributary system of informal criticism," see @moskowitz_immortal_1974.]  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines and their readers used speculative thought to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.  While Gernsback has for better or worse been enshrined as science fiction's founding figure (fans refer to him as "Uncle Hugo"), less well-known are the ways in which he is "the father of American electronic culture," in the words of Franz Pichler, curator of a recent exhibit on Gernsback.[^bwbp]  To come to terms with these two nascent discourses, scientifiction and media culture, we have to see them as emerging from a single continuum.

[^bwbp]:  Co-curated by Pichler and the media theorist Peter Weibel, this exhibit at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie (Center for Art and Media) in Karlsruhe, Germany, was one of two recent museum showcases of Gernsback's life and work.  The other was held at Luxembourg's Centre National de Littérature in 2011.  @pichler_hugo_2013.

One of the challenges in recovering an understanding of science fiction *avant la lettre* is the fact that many of the variables its stories revolved around---science, media, and technology---were concepts still very much in flux in the early twentieth century.  Science as it was understood in the public sphere was a highly variable entity, and had no settled explanations for the accomplishments of new technologies like wireless telegraphy.  These technical media were only just beginning to be understood as *media* in the modern sense of mass communication, and even the term *technology* itself wasn't used in the American English vernacular until the 1920s, as we will see later.^[@guillory_genesis_2010. @marx_technology:_2010.]  The essays that follow, therefore, represent a media theory in the making, one in which *media* are addressed not primarily as mass-cultural forms like cinema or television programming, but as the affordances of and possibilities inherent in the smallest individual components:  the selenium-coated plate, the tungsten lamp, the chromic plunge battery.  In his monthly editorials, feature articles, and short fiction, Gernsback pioneered a kind of writing that combined hard technical description with an openness to the fantastic.  Using interwoven descriptive and narrative frameworks to describe a particular device, experience, or vision of the future, Gernsback followed the smallest of technological developments through to their furthest conclusions:  the increased availability of a light-sensitive alloy implied that the coming of visual telephones was near, and the number of amateurs sending in their own designs for primitive television receivers only served to confirm the imminence of this new mode of communication.

Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in *Modern Electrics* and *Electrical Experimenter* seemed---solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes---Gernsback and his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components to be built.  These new media appeared as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one could pick and choose from the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog.*  Even the long-term projections like thought wave recorders and videophones figured as handicraft futures that would come to pass with just a little more tinkering.  As Samuel R. Delany writes,

> The new American SF took on the practically incantatory task of naming nonexistent objects, then investing them with reality by a host of methods, technological and pseudotechnological explanations, embedding them in dramatic situations, or just inculcating them by pure repetition.^[@delany_critical_2009.]

These gadgets appeared so frequently and in such diverse contexts---as props in short stories, as homemade designs in letters to the editor, as profiles of similar developments across Europe---that one gets the sense paging through the magazines that they are all part of a coherent fictional world, built up across many years and many issues.  Given the pace of technological change in the early twentieth century, it seemed as if any element of this fictional world could bleed into everyday life at any moment.

It's perhaps this penchant in his work to dwell in the extremes of both technical detail and fantastic speculation that accounts for Gernsback's absence in the pages of science fiction studies and from the history of technology.  For the former, he is too obsessed with material details, and as an editor and writer merely produces stylistically bland lists of new devices, what are dismissively referred to as "gadget stories."  For historians of technology, Gernsback's inventions and technical writings are never able to back up their promises, being far too concerned with future contingencies to merit serious attention.  But it's precisely the novel coexistence of these diametrically opposed modes throughout Gernsback's work---soberly technical and wildly speculative---that led to the explosive popularity of his ideas.  Across the thirty-year period covered by this book, the reader will find technical precision and utopian speculation in varying proportions, and articles that toggle from one end of this spectrum to the other with the ease of a tuning knob.

By the 1910s and 20s, the American magazine-reading public was familiar with the idiom of popular science reportage.  While nineteenth-century scientific periodicals in the United States took the form of highly specialized *Proceedings* or *Transactions* or *Reports* of academic research organizations, the *fin de siècle* saw a proliferation of titles aimed at a much broader audience.  *Scientific American* (1845- ) for instance, the best known of these publications and one still in print, attracted a readership that included credentialed researchers, industrial manufacturers, and an interested general public, as well as a "nebulous community of inventors (ranging from the local tinkerer to manufacturer and professional inventor/technologist)."[^psci]  Science in these new magazines was made accessible to a growing number of readers seeking to educate themselves or simply desiring to remain informed about recent developments.  But while Gernsback's magazines may seem familiar to us today through their progeny such as *Wired,* *Popular Science,* and *Popular Mechanics* (the latter two of which are direct successors to Gernsback titles through mergers and acquisitions) they perhaps have more in common with a longer tradition of popular science that blurred the lines between illusion and truth, skepticism and belief.  From medieval displays of the natural world's wondrous curiosities to nineteenth-century phantasmagoria and other audiovisual spectacles, "the positive sciences and the fantastic arts [have been] linked in a dialectic of doubt and certainty," as many historians of science have recently shown.^[@tresch_prophet_2011, p. 18; @daston_wonders_1998; @andriopoulos_ghostly_2013; @williams_aesthetic_1995.]  Unseen forces were at work in the miracle of wireless telegraphy, a literally unbelievable technology that meant disembodied thoughts from around the world could be skimmed from the air in the comfort of your home.  If this miracle were possible, what else might be?

[^psci]: @whalen_periodicals_1980.  For a history of the view that a scientifically educated public was an imperative for American democracy in the early twentieth century, a period during which the concept of "science" itself was being determined largely by secondary school curricula, see @jewett_science_2014, especially Chapters 4 and 7.

For Gernsback and his staff, rapid developments in the electrical arts made the speculative sciences of antigravitation and "thought waves" seem within reach.  From a belief in the presence of the luminiferous ether, to an argument that gravity is an electrical phenomenon, to the suggestion that humans may be able to tap into the so-called sixth senses of animals, or that the earth's core is made of radium and drives recurring cycles of life's evolution, Gernsback's purportedly "scientific" titles reveled in the extraordinary.^[@gernsback_ether_1916; @gernsback_gravitation_1918; @gernsback_unknown_1920; @gernsback_radium_1916]  And while competing magazines like *The Wireless Age, QST,* and *Popular Science Monthly* were gradually opening up the specialist orientation of the sciences to a wider public through sober reportage, Gernsback addressed a growing readership who found the products of science forming an increasingly bewildering part of their everyday lives.  "As time goes on it becomes more apparent that our senses are becoming more and more involved directly due to scientific progress," he wrote.  Listing a miscellany of sensory illusions that had become commonplace, from "blazing names being written out in the night sky" by moving electric signs, to the "radio illusion" of reproduced sound, to the simulated effects of motion in new carnival rides, Gernsback warns that "We should never trust our senses too much in these latter days of scientific progress."^[@gernsback_modern_1927.]  Given the rate of this "progress," the reader should not be surprised if the next great scientific advance, seemingly impossible today, should become commonplace tomorrow.  As we will see over the course of Gernsback's writings, this almost spiritual faith in technoscientific progress remains remarkably unscathed in the wake of the First World War and the Depression.  It was a faith that an American technologist could only claim at a remove from the horrors of the trenches and doubling down with the idea that cultural welfare could be technocratically managed by machines and their engineers (**Human Progress; Wonders of the Machine Age**).  "Progress in science is as infinite as time, it is inconceivable how either would stop" (**Imagination Versus Facts**).

For Gernsback, projections of the future or progress and its wonders were never simply bewildering.  They were the occasion for a material education in the way things worked.  As one reader of and contributor to *Amazing Stories,* G. Peyton Wertenbaker, wrote in a letter to the editor with characteristically pulpy prose, "Beauty is a groping of the emotions towards realization of things which may be unknown only to the intellect" (**Fiction Versus Facts**).  The archaeologist and historian of radio Michael Schiffer refers to Gernsback and his writers as "techno-mancers," arguing that their depictions of wide-ranging futures created a "cultural imperative" for inventors, engineers, and scientists to make these dreams a reality.^[@schiffer_portable_1991, 136]  And in a sense, this is true, with many of the speculative ideas described by Gernsback retrospectively seeming like "predictions" of modern technologies (**Television and the Telephot; What to Invent; Predicting Future Inventions**).  But what makes sense as a neat, two-step model for literature as a source of inspiration and invention was actually a much messier process in practice, like a melody played so fast that the individual notes become indistinguishable.[^sfvt]  The Gernsback titles were unique in their willingness to tackle fantastic topics that other publications wouldn't, and did so through the lens of hands-on technical know-how.  Behind the gadgets of **Ralph 124C 41+: A Romance of the Year 2660,** Gernsback's famous serial novel of 1911, was a marketplace of evocative objects, a forum for amateurs experimenting with these strange new things, and an emerging consensus vision of their possible applications.  Over the course of long-running serial novels and the exchange of reader correspondence, the material basis of scientifiction's marvelous futures was gradually refined.

[^sfvt]: This two-part model of invention forms a common thread in science fiction criticism, with the genre providing a think tank of sorts in magazines, novels, and films, continuously replenishing a reservoir of ideas for technologists to draw upon in their own inventive process.  See for instance @disch_dreams_1998;  @shedroff_make_2012.

This book won't attempt to offer an answer to longstanding debates over whether science fiction had its origins in the pulps or is best considered in relation to a deeper tradition of precursors by Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne, even John Wilkins's *The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone* (1638) or Thomas More's *Utopia* (1516).  Reexamining the works of Hugo Gernsback is not meant to suggest that the cultural, sexual, and ecological complexities of novels like Samuel R. Delany's *Dhalgren* (1975), Kathy Acker's *Empire of the Senseless* (1988), or Paolo Bacigalupi's *The Windup Girl* (2009) can be directly traced to the techno-utopian texts first published in *Amazing Stories.*  As Carl Freedman writes, "current Anglo-American science fiction draws on far more than the pulp tradition that constitutes *one* of its filiations."^[@freedman_critical_2000, p. 15.]  *The Perversity of Things* instead takes seriously Delany's idea that literature and science fiction are two entirely separate phenomena that obey different rules.  In order to fully understand "a tradition of writers who considered themselves craftsmen first and artists secondarily, if at all," we have to move beyond literary critical frameworks that are poorly suited to thinking about craft, materiality, and collective practice.^[@delany_silent_1994, p. 200.  See also @delany_critical_2009.]  Gernsback's handicraft futures seemed so seductive because they were futures that you, the reader, could build yourself.  With the hands-on experience promised by these magazines, the reader could pick up any object and sense its affordances rather than being continuously frustrated by what Gernsback called "the perversity of things."  For Gernsback, objects exert an influence on thought.  The question was how to understand that influence as an inherent promise or beauty, rather than a stubbornness or recalcitrance.  Because the complex things of the modern world seemed to impinge further on daily life with each passing year, it was Gernsback's lifelong project to educate a public in the tenets of "science" through a kind of instinctual know-how or "knack"---a term he returns to in many of his writings.  The idea was to enable the public to contribute to the making of things rather than allow them to be overwhelmed by the perversity of things.

The next section of this introduction, "up-to-date technic," will provide an overview of Gernsback's life, the development of his periodicals and their international circulation, as well as the idiosyncratic figurations of "science" that were deployed throughout.  Unfortunately, the prevailing approach in science fiction studies thus far has been to dismiss the Gernsback magazines as embarrassingly simplistic, tasteless, and even detrimental to the eventual emergence of a mature literature.  This is an ironic and all-too casual judgment of a Jewish immigrant who throughout his life was in search of the respectability as a technologist and editor that always seemed to elude him.^[For a history of the relationship between Jewish identity and science fiction, see @fingeroth_disguised_2009.]  A certain tone seems to have been set early on by the spectacularly racist H.P. Lovecraft's moniker for Gernsback: "Hugo the Rat."  The overwhelming attention that many science fiction critics give, to this day, to the low rates he paid his writers (a common source of tension between *all* pulp writers and their editors) leads to a misplaced derision of Gernsback's literary quality that often carries with it an explicit disgust at his perceived character.[^asmt]  One can be forgiven for wondering why such singular attention is given to bankruptcy proceedings, profits, and wages in works of literary historical scholarship.  

Meanwhile, almost entirely overlooked has been the way that the overlapping publics attracted to Gernsback's magazines opened a space for voices that were otherwise explicitly occluded from public discourse.  The following section, "a perfect Babel of voices," profiles these communities.  As Steve Silberman has shown, "Both amateur radio and science fiction fandom offered ways of gaining social recognition outside traditional channels."^[@silberman_neurotribes:_2015.]  These magazines promised a populist education in new scientific and technical principles that would offer social inroads for wage laborers hoping to secure middle class careers, women who took advantage of the anonymity of Morse code and of the power to reach an audience of countless listeners from home, as well as those "who found it nearly impossible to communicate through speech" due to a range of neurological conditions, such as the one we might associate today with autism.^[@silberman_neurotribes:_2015.]

[^asmt]: For Brian Stableford, Gernsback's "cowardly" launch of *Amazing Stories* was "purely a commercial adventure, which Gernsback undertook because he thought his existing subscription lists might help establish a secure commercial base for such a magazine."  @stableford_creators_1997.  Malcolm J. Edwards argues that Gernsback “bestowed upon his creation provincial dogmatism and an illiteracy that bedeviled US SF for years."  @clute_gernsback_1995, p. 491.  Richard Bleiler sees him as "a disastrous (if not a pernicious) figure, a man whose stultifying vision and lack of literary taste led to the establishment of a literature that for too many years was considered a laughingstock, that emphasized other elements than literary quality, and, perhaps worse [sic] of all, that paid the majority of its writers badly."  @grossman_hugo_2011.

In the next two sections, "'phone and code" and "certain future instrumentalities," Gernsback's inventions and his theorization of tinkering take center stage.  At a moment in which the energies of American invention were shifting from independent amateurs to corporate research labs, Gernsback's devices increasingly incorporated metaphor, narrative, and a sense of humor.  As technical solutions to some of the most pressing problems in the development of radio, television, and other emerging media, they relied on his theory of amateur tinkering as an activity distinct from, and even superior to, "invention" by credentialed researchers and engineers.  These arguments anticipate a recent movement in academic media studies known as critical making, which advocates a material engagement with technology as a means of understanding it.  Making things allows us "to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration."^[@ratto_critical_2011.  See also @dieter_virtues_2014.]  Media studies scholars will find many other forms of argumentation and analysis throughout Gernsback's writing to be familiar.  This is perhaps no surprise, given the longstanding fascination in media studies with science fictional metaphors like virtuality, prosthetic extensions, and cyberspace.  But the pages that follow suggest something more at work than mere echoes in terminology:  the Gernsback magazines constitute a forgotten and decidedly pulpy point of origin for today's academic discipline.  Science fiction in its early days wasn't just a literary form, it was a mode of interacting with and understanding media.

The introduction's final section, "we exploit the future," profiles Gernsback's contributions to the science fiction genre.  The literary-historical gambit is to recover the radical sense of openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of scientifiction stories who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that "Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible" (**A New Sort of Magazine**).  Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.

*The Perversity of Things* thus seeks to provide a reappraisal of the communities of amateur experimenters that participated in the early-twentieth-century emergence of new media, of the "hard" technical roots of American science fiction, and of the highly imaginative orientation toward media technologies that was prevalent during this period.  This isn't the story of an Edison or a Jobs, inventors whose creations for better or worse have changed the way we inhabit the world.  Rather, Gernsback's career left us with a way of participating in that change, imagining its possible futures, and debating which future it is that we should live in.  This is the story of the development of a community, of a series of practices, and of a way to approach the technologized world.
