It's the summer of 1906 in downtown Manhattan and Lewis Coggeshall hovers over a bucket of dimes in the back room of the Electro Importing Company's retail store, filing them down to a coarse powder.  Sitting amid shelves of electrolytic detectors, circuit switches, ammeters, and Geissler tubes ready for sale to the city's growing community of amateur experimenters, he lets the metal filings fall into a small cardboard box at his feet.  Making a coherer, one of the earliest forms of radio receiver, required a certain amount of culinary improvisation in order to find the proportion of metals that would produce the strongest signal possible.  Dimes were then minted on ninety percent silver, so Coggeshall’s next steps were to mix the filings with the perfect ratio of iron powder and finally to pour that mixture into a small glass vial.[^mrc]  When a radio frequency wave comes in contact with this handmade coherer, the metal filings would cling together or "cohere," allowing the signal to flow between electrodes connected to either end of the vial and, depending on how long the telegraph key on the transmitting end is depressed, produce a "dot" or a "dash" in Morse code.  Connecting this coherer to a spark gap, a power source, a bell, and mounting all of the components onto a wooden base [[BREAKDOWN OF TELIMCO RECEIVER COMPONENTS, ALSO THE CITED WORKS BELOW]], Coggeshall has produced one more Telimco, a portmanteau of The Electro Importing Company and the first fully-assembled radio set ever sold to the American public. ^[@_telimco_2002. @gernsback_50_1956.]

Before the transmission of voice or music was possible, the airwaves were filled with the pulse of rhythmic bells or telegraphic beeps.

Meanwhile in the offices upstairs, the founder of Electro Importing Hugo Gernsback writes increasingly breathless advertising copy on the Telimco, promising it to be a means of professional success and economic mobility for motivated young people.  In one issue of the *Electro Importing Company Catalog*, a mail-in marketplace that provided access to "Everything for the Experimenter" from a company who claimed to be "the largest makers of experimental Wireless Material in the world," Gernsback promises: "We give you the opportunity to tick yourself up to the head of a future wireless telegraph company as did Marconi, De Forest and others."  Gernsback priced the set at $7.50 and claimed that it required no more expertise than a working knowledge of Morse code (the transmission of audio or voice was not yet possible with what was then called "wireless telegraphy").  First advertised in the November 25, 1905 issue of *Scientific American*, the Telimco appeared thereafter every two weeks, quickly becoming one of the best selling items for sale in the Catalog.  Gernsback traveled to Macy’s, Gimbels, Marshall Field, and FAO Schwartz, giving demonstrations of the device to incredulous salesmen who had little to no familiarity with “wireless,” a technology whose operation still wasn’t understood even by the scientific community.

Coggeshall, who began his career as a telegraph operator for the Erie Railroad, first met Gernsback at a boardinghouse on 14th Street where they were both staying. [@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 231]

But the Telimco was not exactly the revolutionary device that brought radio to the masses Gernsback later liked to claim it was.  Though its advertisements claimed the set was "guaranteed to work up to one mile," the Telimco was notoriously finicky.^[@_wireless_1905]  As it was sold, the outfit had a range of merely 300-500 feet and could only receive signals from further distances when a large antenna was hooked up.  Further, it was highly susceptible to any kind of electrical interference, such as the elevator motor in the Electro Importing Company building, which caused difficulties during in-store demonstrations of the apparatus.  The Telimco's untuned circuits, which would produce a high degree of interference for any nearby radio station, would be outlawed by the 1912 Radio Act.  For these reasons, its metal filings coherers "had all but disappeared from commercial work in 1910" according to historian of early radio Thomas White. ^[@white_pioneering_1996]  From this perspective, the Telimco seems less a practical means of communication than a proof of concept for a growing group of "electrics" hobbyists.  

What sort of artifact, then, is the Telimco for the historian and theorist of media technologies?  Does it deserve credit for being a historical "first," one of the earliest consumer-friendly sets that would pave the way for radio broadcasting and domestic listening in later decades?  Do we overlook its technical faults, as we do the almost unplayable tin foil phonograph cylinders first released by Edison, in favor of the idea behind the prototype and what it later would become?  Or do we pass it by as a marketing gimmick, a fiction, in favor of technical developments that offer more objectively measurable achievements?

Perhaps the Telimco provides a nostalgic glimpse at an era when advanced media technologies were handmade by their users, their operation still more of an alchemy than a science.  Today, critical practice and the culture at large are both infused with an "affective nostalgia" in thinking about technology, in the words of Jussi Parikka.  "Vintage is considered better than the new, Super-8 and 8-bit sounds are objects of not only nostalgia but also revival and retrocultures seem to be as natural a part of the digital-culture landscape as high-definition screen technology and super-fast broadband."^[@parikka_what_2012, p. 2]  Part of "the media-archaeological spirit of thinking the new and the old in parallel lines," argues Parikka, involves the acknowledgement that old or "dead" media are "continuously remediated, resurfacing, finding new uses, context, adaptations."

But what were some of the historically situated understandings of this technology?  With the benefit of hindsight we can decide on the Telimco's feasibility, significance, and what kind of historicity we want to claim for it.  What we'd miss, however, is the context in which this artifact emerged.  More interesting than the gap between the actual abilities and the claims surrounding the Telimco and other Electro Importing devices is the structure through which these claims were made.  Before Hugo Gernsback's most famous publication was released in 1926---*Amazing Stories*, the first science fiction magazine---a speculative language for assessing the cultural impact of new media was introduced in the *Electro Importing Company Catalog* and refined with his technology and tinkering magazines like *Modern Electrics* (first published in 1908), *Electrical Experimenter* (1913), *Radio News* (1919), *Science & Invention* (1920), *Television* (1927), *Short-Wave Craft* (1930), and *Technocracy Review* (1933).  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of Gernsback's magazines seemed---solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes---his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appeared as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one could pick and choose from out of the pages of the *Catalog*.

Technical literacy was encouraged not only through blueprints and instruction manuals for the amateur tinkerer, but also through thought experiments and graphical projections of what these new media might look like.  This was Gernsback's forté: reading fantastic possibilities for the future of technologically advanced societies off the shape of the most mundane of material objects, techniques and processes---even the silver filings of a dime.

These amateur experimenter magazines covered not just the most spectacular and popular of the mass media, such as cinema and wireless telegraphy, but the affordances of the smallest individual components:  the selenium-coated plate, the tungsten lamp, the chromic plunge battery.  In the blueprints of *Modern Electrics* all the way through the short fiction of *Amazing Stories*, the addition and subtraction of each wire, coherer, or tuning hookup constituted a full-scale shift in the abilities and sensory affects of the apparatus being constructed as well as the narrative form through which it was described.  Moreover, these publications developed interleaving descriptive and narrative frameworks within which to describe these devices and experiences.  No longer was it sufficient to profile the technical specifications of a device or the mechanical arrangement of its parts.  Instead, magazines like *Radio News* and *Science and Invention* followed technological developments through to their most logical, and sometimes extreme, conclusions:  the increased availability of a light-sensitive alloy implied that the coming of visual telephones was near, and the number of amateurs sending in their own designs for primitive television receivers only served to confirm the immanence of this new mode of communication.

The Telimco was one of countless artifacts profiled in the Gernsback magazines that blurred the lines between the real and the imaginary.  Part branding exercise, part rallying call to a community of active amateur experimenters, Gernsback gave names to these ideas like the Aerophone (a name for wireless audio transmission, rather than merely telegraphic code), the Telephot (an early conceptualization of the videophone), and the Hypnobioscope (an automated thought transcription and playback machine).  These gadgets appeared so frequently and in such diverse contexts---as props in short stories, homemade designs in letters to the editor, and profiles of similar developments across Europe---that one gets the sense paging through the magazines that they are all part of a coherent fictional world, built up across many years and many issues.  Given the pace of technological change in the early twentieth century, it seemed as if any one element of this fictional world could bleed into everyday life at any moment.

All of this began with the *Electro Importing Catalog.*  Gernsback's *Modern Electrics* began as a mail-order catalogue for imported wireless parts and exotic electrical miscellany in 1905.  After several issues of the mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, *Electro Importing* began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor.  Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog grew into a series of monthly magazines for the wireless homebrewer, beginning with *Modern Electrics* in 1908 and the offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company in 1915, later expanding to a fleet of popular and specialist magazines like *Electrical Experimenter, Radio News, Science & Invention*, and the *Technocracy Review*.  The transition from the mail-order catalog to the "slick paper" monthly magazine format was a smooth one, evidenced by the fact that the third edition (1908) of the Electro Importing catalog bears the title of the new full-format magazine, "Modern Electrics."  

While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, Germany, France, and in Gernsback's own company offices.  Regular reporters like H. Winfield Secor and René Homer, celebrity guest contributors such as Lee De Forest, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla, as well as the unnamed Paris Correspondent and Berlin Correspondent provided reports on television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

Though Hugo Gernsback is best remembered today for launching the first science fiction magazine, *Amazing Stories* (1926), and the Hugo Award is given out each year to the best works in the genre, he now receives little more than a one- to two-sentence nod in science fiction studies. He is associated with the gaudy covers of his magazines and a "crude and heavy-handed" editorial style that perpetuated many of the negative stereotypes still associated with science fiction today. Much of this attitude has been inherited from a generation of science fiction scholars who were not academics but editors themselves, and disparaged Gernsback's editorial practices as well as the infamously low wages he paid his writers. But this inherited version focuses only on the period from *Amazing Stories* and after, entirely overlooking the context of the genre's birth in Gernsback's experimenter magazines, as well as his work as a pioneer in media technologies and broadcasting techniques.

Titled after an essay of his on the influence that objects exert on thought, *The Perversity of Things: Writings on Media, Technology, and Science Fiction* makes available texts by Gernsback that were foundational for both science fiction and the emergence of media studies.  These editorials, speculative blueprints, literary critical essays, and media histories have been out of print since their original publication in Gernsback's magazines from 1905-1933.  Together, they show how his publications evolved from an electrical parts catalog into a fully-fledged literary genre, an altogether untold story in American literary and media history.  As the curator of a [recent exhibit](http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%248492) on Gernsback at the ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology), Franz Pichler writes, "Hugo Gernsback is the father of American electronic culture."^[@pichler_hugo_2013]  With his monthly editorials, feature articles, and short fiction, Gernsback pioneered a kind of writing that combined hard technical description with an openness to the fantastic. It was a mixture out of which an entire literary genre emerged to tackle the question of the distinctive specificity of "medium" in a new wireless age in the opening decades of the twentieth century.  *The Perversity of Things* will show that science fiction emerged in the United States as a discourse on media.
