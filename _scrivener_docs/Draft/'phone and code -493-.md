"'phone and code": Wireless, Television, and Other Emerging Media

=======================================================

[[reframe to solely consist of an analysis of the "public" or the "community" that constituted emerging media]]

"We are constantly being speeded up mentally," writes Gernsback in 1923 with the concision of a McLuhan aphorism (**Are We Intelligent?**).  Understanding media was one of the primary goals of these magazines, not just from the perspective of the inventor but also of the bemused end user.  "Everything we are doing now is too cumbersome. . . . Our lives are crowded to such an extent, that it is impossible to read as much as our grandfathers could."  Sensory environments had become so packed, so distracting, that it was time to think about a better medium to communicate complex information to the public.  Gernsback designed magazines like *Science and Invention* to match the new speeds with which people disseminated information, so that many of these articles not only work through the rapidly evolving media and their shaping of how we communicate with one another and understand the world, but also the magazine itself as a medium capable of keeping up with these developments.  "If a picture can tell the story in two seconds why should one read a typed story which might occupy 10 or 15 minutes of one's time?"  As Susan Douglas writes,  "the press’s method of covering and interpreting technological change was developed.  In other words, what scholars have identified as the functions of the mass media in the late twentieth century were being formulated and refined during the first twenty-three years of radio’s history."^[@douglas_inventing_1987, p. xix]  Gernsback's ideas were purpose-built to move fast, which often becomes clear in the quality of Gernsback's prose, as he churned out multiple articles per month.  But where did these new media come from, and how could people participate in the conditions of their emergence rather than feeling like they had been swept up in their wake?

With many of his writings, Gernsback leaves the reader with the sense that media "evolve" according to their own logic.  In **Is Radio at a Standstill?,* he makes a striking media historical analogy between the supposed threat that the rise of radio broadcasting posed to established phonograph manufacturers, and the impact of the “eliminator” (a lighter, more portable, and rechargeable source of power developed in the mid-20s) to conventional battery manufacturers.  In the model that Gernsback outlines here of the historical cycles that the technology industry goes through, competing formats---whether the medium is electricity or audio---do not replace but rather force one another to find their own unique attributes, simply as a matter of survival.  In his media historical writings, Gernsback often speaks of the "perfection" of an apparatus, a question of medium specificity he almost always raises through the lens of viable business models.  Despite his penchant for projecting far-flung futures, Gernsback was often remarkably conservative when it came to the specifics of precisely how long such perfection would take, and what it would mean for developments in emerging media like wireless (later radio) and television.  Given the small sample size of these very young histories, there was little the technologist had to go in in thinking about the stable, almost Platonic forms that would emerge from the still-underdetermined interaction between rapidly changing technologies and cultural forms.  As he writes in **Edison and Radio**:

> The radio industry today is only five years old, and it may safely be predicted that when it becomes as old as the phonograph is today we shall hardly be able to recognize it as the same development.  It is admitted that radio is not yet perfect.  Neither is the phonograph, nor the automobile, or motion pictures, nor electric lights; nor, for that matter, a pair of shoes.

In a move that is perhaps unexpected for a technofuturist like Gernsback, he frequently tempers what he saw as a boosterish furor over the rapid development of new technologies.  By 1927, radio was firmly cemented in American life as an everyday piece of household furniture.  Not only were radios rapidly spreading into homes across the country after the so-called "radio Christmas" of 1924, but the legislative frameworks that would determine the structure of American broadcasting were finally being hammered out.^["More than ten times the number of tube sets were manufactured in 1925 than just two years earlier, and four times as many speakers as in 1923."  @douglas_listening_1999, 78].  Despite this seemingly overnight explosion, Gernsback writes in 1927, “there have not been any revolutionary improvements in radio and it is likely there will not be any."  Instead, people should expect a long process of gradual refinement:

> It is this process of slow evolution that we may expect in the future, as well, and the old adage also holds true in radio: "Natura non facit saltum"---which, translated, says that Nature does not make jumps.  In other words, all developments are part of a slow-moving plan of evolution.  Even revolutionary inventions, when they do come along, will be found in the end to be not half as great a departure as they were thought to be at first.^[@gernsback_coming_1926.]

What Gernsback could do, however, was read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of emerging media.  In many of his editorials, the history of media is evoked not merely as a nostalgic trip back to the devices of yesteryear, but as an archive of possibilities ripe for future experimentation. For instance, in another 1927 editorial, at a moment when national broadcast networks were flickering to life and music and variety programs were flooding the country, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people's minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology. Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying wireless telegraphy became "radio," an everyday part of household furniture, Gernsback writes, "the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy. . . .  There is hardly any industry today that cannot make use of radio instruments in some phase of its work."^[@gernsback_radio_1927.]  His examples range from a force-field like burglar alarm, to automating the recording of lightning strikes, from measuring the minute weight and touch of a fly to scanning factory workers for stolen metals.  And, in a forgotten example of Gernsback's own from the 1900s (which he christened **The Dynamophone**) electric motors can be started remotely by the human voice, proving that "the apparatus foreshadowed broadcasting: the human voice actually did create effects at the receiving end," both for machines and humans.  Gernsback consistently reminds us that the inherent abilities of wireless, of information transmitted through the air, has now itself been scattered by the winds of technological evolution and inflects our understanding of and interaction with a fantastic number of techniques, technologies, and media.  This wasn't just a historiographical move.  In articles like **New Radio 'Things' Wanted,** Gernsback encouraged home experimenters to remix and retrofit old technologies in order to imagine what the next great advance in radio might look like.  Pieces like this both educated an expanding public on precisely how this technology worked, as well as sought out new paths forward that may have been overlooked.

Setting aside the seeming perversity of emerging media that allowed them to evolve as if according to their own internal logic, Gernsback elsewhere emphasizes the important role that users played in developing these new cultural forms.  In this sense, the merits of one detector over another were far less important than the new kinds of connection they made possible.  Similar to the approach Gernsback took to many other ideas, this shift in emphasis didn't necessarily happen over a certain period of time or unfold in any sort of linear fashion.  While there were of course the signature themes that he returned to throughout his career, Gernsback's media theory doesn't constitute a rigorous, internally consistent philosophical system.  Writing two, sometimes three or more articles a month meant that he was firing off ideas as they came to him, ideas that were picked up and discarded as utility demanded.  For this reason, it's not quite accurate to describe these variations as contradictions.  Instead, they reflect the thinking of a tinkerer, comfortable with fragments and capable of applying any one of multiple perspectives to a single issue.

So, when Gernsback's writings aren't emphasizing the material specificity of wireless as a means of understanding the shape that medium might take in the future, they were describing it as an inherently ethereal meeting place of people from around the globe.  In "the most inspiring example of the triumph of mind over matter" (**A Treatise on Wireless Telegraphy**), simple minerals like zinc and copper could be harnessed to transmit the self, live across the ocean.  "We are now on the threshold of the wireless era, and just beginning to rub our intellectual eyes, as it were" (**Wireless Association of America**).  Wireless promised constant contact between friends, family, and complete strangers regardless of location.  "The radiophone," he wrote using another short-lived name for radio before the fact, "will link moving humanity with the stationary one" (**The Future of Wireless**).^[Gernsback continues to use the term "radiophone" as late as 1923.]  In other words, developing "wireless tele-mechanics" meant that even people driving in automobiles could maintain a conversation with someone sitting at home.  In 1909, Gernsback began publishing an annual wireless *Blue Book* containing the names and call signs of amateur wireless operators around the country.  The announcement of this annual directory that promised more and more citizens of the ether popping up on the map with each passing year alongside his feature on sending and receiving wireless signals from Mars (**Signaling to Mars**) makes it seem as if soon, even Martians will be addressable in the *Blue Book.*  Less than a decade later, Gernsback could write that "In our big cities thousands of ears listen every minute of the day to what is going on in the vast ether-ocean" (**War and the Radio Amateur**).

One wonders throughout his writings just how inclusive this global village of amateur experimenters was in practice.  Though Gernsback himself is remarkably silent on all questions regarding race, gender, and class---perhaps in an effort to avoid alienating any potential readers---advertisements for radio parts, books, and professional schools largely addressed a male audience.  The most vocal participants in the technology magazines' correspondence section, and thus their most immediately visible readers, were roughly 16-24 year old males, who often equated the pursuit of science with masculinity itself.  As one reader wrote, pursuing radio as a hobby "stills a thirst for scientific knowledge and hence stimulates manhood" (**Who Will Save the Radio Amateur?**).  But this doesn't mean that other demographics weren't reading and using Gernsback's magazines.  The wireless community of the early twentieth century may have been more heterogeneous than is initally apparent on the surface of these magazines.  Steve Silberman identifies wireless amateurism as a haven for voices that may have otherwise been excluded from public discourse:

> The culture of wireless was also a strict meritocracy where no one cared about what you looked like or how gracefully you deported yourself in public.  If you knew how to set up a rig and keep it running, you were welcome to join the party. . . . [It] also enabled shy introverts to study the protocols of personal engagement from a comfortable distance. “Through amateur radio . . . I’ve learned so much about communication between people.  I’ve had the opportunity to observe and participate in the giving and getting process, which is what communication is all about,” recalled Lenore Jensen, who co-founded the Young Ladies’ Radio League in 1939 to encourage more women to join the conversation.^[@silberman_neurotribes:_2015.]

Highly scripted conversational formats and the anonymity of code allowed for a neurodiversity and gender inclusion within this community that is difficult to recover from the pages of Gernsback's magazines alone.  One has to read *Electrical Experimenter* and *Radio News* against the grain to find the presence of women, for instance.  But there are several notable examples in reports from contributors, including Maria Dolores Estrada, a Mexican civil war refugee turned licensed wireless operator, and Graynella Packer, "the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity.^[@_mexican_1917.  @_feminine_1916.]  The "Autobiography of a Girl Amateur" offers an anonymous account of one woman's success in attaining a respected status among the wireless community by never revealing more about herself then her call letters, which she of course doesn't reveal in the article.^[@_autobiography_1920]  The archive is worth digging into further.

Though it is indeed rare that women make more than a cameo appearance in the pages of these magazines, a later editorial by Gernsback makes clear that they played a vital role at virtually every level of the magazine's production.  A 1928 issue of *Science of Invention* opens with a fanciful tale in which King Outis VII of Erehwon, a great fan of the magazine, visits the offices of Experimenter Publishing to witness how the magazine is made.  He meets with editors, artists, advertising staff, linotypers, compositors, proof-readers, the binding department, and photographers.  Following the supply chain even deeper, Gernsback introduces the King to the "chemical houses who furnished the chemicals for making the pulp and bleaching it," the coal mines that made possible the steam to make that sulphite pulp paper, even the hens that laid the eggs "used in the photo-engraving process to supply albumen."  When the King finally asks "who all the pretty girls were that had clustered together in one aggregation," 

> We informed him immediately that they were secretaries, stenographers and typists, as well as editors and proofreaders and many others who had directly to do with the production of the magazine.  The firm that did the composing had several dozen girls that performed various jobs in connection with the magazine.  The printer had a number of girls who were either bookkeepers or stenographers, through whose hands passed the bills for the magazine, and the same was true of practically every other industry connected with the production of the magazine.^[@gernsback_magazine_1928.]

Rarely made visible in the content of the magazines themselves, women were there at every stage in the process of their production, from the chemical supply houses to the newsdealers, even if Gernsback can't conceptualize this contribution as anything more than the circuits that connect and regulate all of the magazine's material inputs and outputs.^[For a history of the influential role women played in periodical publishing throughout the nineteenth century, see @harris_blue_2004.]
