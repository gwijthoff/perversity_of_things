"'phone and code": Communities of Inquiry and Wireless Publics

=======================================================

"We are constantly being speeded up mentally," writes Gernsback in 1923 with the concision of a Marshall McLuhan aphorism (**Are We Intelligent?**).  Understanding media was one of the primary goals of these magazines, not just from the perspective of the expert experimenter but also of the bemused end user.  "Everything we are doing now is too cumbersome. . . . Our lives are crowded to such an extent, that it is impossible to read as much as our grandfathers could."  Sensory environments had become so packed, so distracting, that it was time to find a better medium to communicate complex information to the public.  During this period, as Susan Douglas has shown, "the press’s method of covering and interpreting technological change was developed.  In other words, what scholars have identified as the functions of the mass media in the late twentieth century were being formulated and refined during the first twenty-three years of radio’s history."^[@douglas_inventing_1987, p. xix.]  It's no mistake that Gernsback explicitly refers to the magazine itself as a "medium" capable of matching the new speeds at which people took in the world (**A New Sort of Magazine; The 'New' Science and Invention**).  His publications, his ideas, and his prose were purpose-built to move fast in a pulp environment with short deadlines and low overhead, and it was for this reason that they were uniquely suited to the analysis of rapidly shifting media conditions.  While this speed sometimes results in seeming contradictions and an all-too hasty embrace of the new, it also contributes to an inviting sense of openness for a diverse community of inquiry.  A core set of his essays take up the question of where new media come from, as well as how ordinary people could participate in the conditions of their emergence rather than feeling like they had been swept up in their wake.

Many writings in this collection will leave the reader with a sense that media "evolve" according to their own logic.  In **Is Radio at a Standstill?,** Gernsback makes a striking media historical analogy between the supposed threat that the rise of radio broadcasting posed to established phonograph manufacturers, and the impact of the “eliminator” (a lighter, more portable, and rechargeable source of power developed in the mid-1920s) to conventional battery manufacturers.  In the model that Gernsback outlines here of the historical cycles that the technology industry goes through, competing formats do not replace but rather force one another to find their own unique attributes, simply as a matter of survival.  In his media historical writings, Gernsback often speaks of the "perfection" of an apparatus, a question of medium specificity he almost always raises through the lens of viable business models.  Despite his penchant for projecting far-flung futures, Gernsback was often remarkably conservative when it came to the specifics of precisely how long such perfection would take, and what it would mean for developments in emerging media like wireless and television.  Given the small sample size of these very young histories, there was little the technologist had to go on when thinking about the stable, almost Platonic forms that might emerge from the parallax interplay of rapidly changing technologies and new cultural forms.  As he writes in **Edison and Radio**:

> The radio industry today is only five years old, and it may safely be predicted that when it becomes as old as the phonograph is today we shall hardly be able to recognize it as the same development.  It is admitted that radio is not yet perfect.  Neither is the phonograph, nor the automobile, or motion pictures, nor electric lights; nor, for that matter, a pair of shoes.

Not only was the concept of "wireless" itself---and later "television"---a moving target for its early adopters, but also for legislators who scrambled to craft regulatory frameworks for information in the air.  Gernsback's magazines avidly followed broadcast policy debates, and much of the power of their arguments against regulation derived from an understanding of media technologies as highly fluid entities that no legislation could hope to keep up with:

> Radio has always been able to take care of itself, and will continue to do so in the future.  To be sure, we all want a radio law to straighten out some of our present tangles, but in the end radio engineering will make the best law obsolete.^[@gernsback_broadcasting_1926]

In the years leading up to World War I, when Gernsback was most active in organizing communities of amateur experimenters against proposed federal broadcast regulation, the magazine's staff had to rely on significant amounts of conjecture in reporting on developments that took place largely behind closed doors between the US Department of Commerce and Labor and various private entities:  "all of this maneuvering that could have so altered American communications and culture transpired behind the scrim of corporate confidentiality, not to be made public until scholarly investigation decades later."^[@wu_master_2010, p. 80.]  Nevertheless, *Modern Electrics* was able to recommend best practices for wireless amateurs so that the community could avoid drawing the scrutiny of regulators (**The Wireless Joker**), play nicely with government stations whose apparatuses were "three years behind time" and whose manners were even worse (**The Roberts Wireless Bill**), and make technical recommendations on frequency allocation that were later incorporated into Congress's Wireless Act of 1912 (**The Alexander Wireless Bill**).  The Electro Importing Company began publishing it's annual *Blue Book* in 1909, a telephone book of sorts that listed the names and call signs of amateur wireless operators around the country, and later, the world.  Its presence was designed to encourage greater accountability for the content of wireless messages once the names of their senders were shared openly and freely (**Signaling to Mars**).  In addition, Gernsback and his associates formed **The Wireless Association of America** in 1910, an education and outreach organization that ended up training many of the wireless operators that the Navy would need once the U.S. entered the Great War in 1917, one of who even developed a means of recording clandestine German U-boat commands that were being relayed through a New Jersey wireless station, unbeknownst to the American government (**Sayville**).  With the outbreak of the war, the Navy outlawed all amateur wireless broadcasting activities and took sole control of the airwaves.  *Modern Electrics* thus became a community forum for frustrations over this policy, as well as a drawing board for what broadcast regulation should look like once the war was over.  While the positions taken up by contributors to and readers of the Gernsback magazines don't amount to a full-scale regulation policy, their arguments against hasty legislation that restricted the rights of everyday users were a series of reactions to conditions on the ground that are very much reminiscent of advocates for free and open-source software today.

So, while at certain moments Gernsback evokes the seeming perversity of emerging media that allowed them to evolve as if according to their own internal logic, at others it was clear that communities of users were driving the developments in these new cultural forms in a way that would make any existing, and likely future, legal frameworks obsolete.  In this sense, the merits of one detector over another were far less important than the new kinds of connection they made possible.  Similar to the approach Gernsback took to many other ideas, this difference in emphasis didn't necessarily happen over a certain period of time or unfold in any sort of linear fashion.  While there were of course the signature themes that he returned to throughout his career, Gernsback's media theory doesn't constitute a rigorous, internally consistent philosophical system.  Writing two, sometimes three or more articles a month meant that he was firing off ideas as they came to him, ideas that were picked up and discarded as utility demanded.  For this reason, it's not quite accurate to describe these variations as contradictions.  Instead, they reflect the thinking of a tinkerer, comfortable with fragments and capable of applying any one of multiple perspectives to a single issue.

When Gernsback's writings weren't emphasizing the material specificity of wireless as a means of understanding the shape that medium might take in the future, they were describing it as an inherently ethereal meeting place of people from around the globe.  In "the most inspiring example of the triumph of mind over matter" (**A Treatise on Wireless Telegraphy**), simple minerals like zinc and copper could be harnessed to transmit the self, live across the ocean.  "We are now on the threshold of the wireless era, and just beginning to rub our intellectual eyes, as it were" (**Wireless Association of America**).  Wireless promised constant contact between friends, family, and complete strangers regardless of location.  "The radiophone," he wrote using another short-lived name for radio before the fact, "will link moving humanity with the stationary one" (**The Future of Wireless**).^[Gernsback continues to use the term "radiophone" as late as 1923, signaling an understanding of radio as a point-to-point means of interpersonal communication even as the national broadcast networks were flickering to life.]  In other words, developing "wireless tele-mechanics" meant that even people driving in automobiles could maintain a conversation with someone sitting at home.  "In our big cities thousands of ears listen every minute of the day to what is going on in the vast ether-ocean" (**War and the Radio Amateur**).  The announcement of the annual *Blue Book* not only promised more and more citizens of the ether popping up on the map with each passing year, it appeared alongside Gernsback's feature on sending and receiving wireless signals from Mars, making it seem as if soon we will even be able to look up our Martian friends in the universal wireless directory.

As Gernsback welcomed these newly minted citizens of the ether stepping "out into the star-lit night and myriads of voices" (**Amateur Radio Restored**), one wonders throughout his writings just how inclusive this global village of amateur experimenters was in practice.  Though Gernsback himself is remarkably silent on all questions regarding race, gender, and class---perhaps in an effort to avoid alienating any potential readers---his magazines' advertisements for radio parts, books, and professional schools largely addressed a male audience.  The most vocal participants in the technology magazines' correspondence section, and thus their most immediately visible readers, were roughly 16-24 year old men, who often equated the pursuit of science with masculinity itself.  As one reader commented, pursuing radio as a hobby "stills a thirst for scientific knowledge and hence stimulates manhood" (**Who Will Save the Radio Amateur?**).  But this doesn't mean that other demographics weren't reading and using Gernsback's magazines.  Eric Drown has convincingly argued that historians of science fiction have "repressed the working-class accents of pulp SF and been content to characterize it as a form of children's literature justly and rapidly replaced by a more mature form of 'speculative fiction.'"^[@drown_business_2006, p. 28]  Drawing on Michael Denning's scholarship on the complex relationship between writers and readers of nineteenth-century dime novels in which "mostly middle-class writers ventriloquized the working-class accents of their readers to advance their views of the world," Drown reminds us that the common dismissal of these texts as "semi-literate" and "adolescent" constitutes a serious misunderstanding of the complex voicings of hourly laborers seeking the promise of secure, middle-class occupations through the "scientific" education these magazines provided.

> . . . readers were largely but not exclusively wage-earning people who describe themselves in letter columns as students, engineers, radio operators, amateur scientists, mill hands, office workers, salesmen, lathe operators, enlisted men, and government bureaucrats. While there was a significantly visible contingent of precocious mostly middle-class boys among the letter-writers, most readers were the adults who provided the routine intellectual, clerical, mechanical and physical labor that made the new mass production economy function.^[@drown_business_2006, p. 8.]

Further, this community may have been more heterogeneous than is initially apparent on the surface of the magazines.  Steve Silberman identifies wireless amateurism as a haven for voices that may have otherwise been excluded from public discourse:

> The culture of wireless was also a strict meritocracy where no one cared about what you looked like or how gracefully you deported yourself in public.  If you knew how to set up a rig and keep it running, you were welcome to join the party. . . . [It] also enabled shy introverts to study the protocols of personal engagement from a comfortable distance. “Through amateur radio . . . I’ve learned so much about communication between people.  I’ve had the opportunity to observe and participate in the giving and getting process, which is what communication is all about,” recalled Lenore Jensen, who co-founded the Young Ladies’ Radio League in 1939 to encourage more women to join the conversation.^[@silberman_neurotribes:_2015.]

Highly scripted conversational formats and the anonymity of code allowed for a neurodiversity and gender inclusion within this community that is difficult to recover from the pages of Gernsback's magazines alone.  One has to read *Electrical Experimenter* and *Radio News* against the grain to find the presence of women.  But there are several notable examples in reports from contributors, including Maria Dolores Estrada, a Mexican civil war refugee turned licensed wireless operator, and Graynella Packer, "the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity."^[@_mexican_1917.]  A woman identified as "Mrs. Alexander MacKenzie" used her son's wireless outfit in the service of the New York Women's Suffrage Party's twenty-four-hour election night demonstration in November 1915 to make speeches and relay messages "from various celebrities and other suffragists."^[@_feminine_1916.]  And the "Autobiography of a Girl Amateur" offers an anonymous account of one woman's success in attaining a respected status among the wireless community by never revealing more about herself then her call letters, which she of course doesn't reveal in the article.^[@_autobiography_1920]  This archive demands further digging.

Though it is indeed rare that women make more than a cameo appearance in the pages of these magazines, one *Science and Invention* editorial by Gernsback makes clear that they played a vital role at virtually every level of the magazine's production.  A 1928 issue opens with a fanciful tale in which King Outis VII of Erehwon, a great fan of the magazine, visits the offices of Experimenter Publishing to witness how the magazine is made.  He meets with editors, artists, advertising staff, linotypers, compositors, proof-readers, the binding department, and photographers.  Following the supply chain even deeper, Gernsback introduces the King to the "chemical houses who furnished the chemicals for making the pulp and bleaching it," the coal mines that made possible the steam to make that sulfite pulp paper, even the hens that laid the eggs "used in the photo-engraving process to supply albumen."  When the King finally asks "who all the pretty girls were that had clustered together in one aggregation," 

> We informed him immediately that they were secretaries, stenographers and typists, as well as editors and proofreaders and many others who had directly to do with the production of the magazine.  The firm that did the composing had several dozen girls that performed various jobs in connection with the magazine.  The printer had a number of girls who were either bookkeepers or stenographers, through whose hands passed the bills for the magazine, and the same was true of practically every other industry connected with the production of the magazine.^[@gernsback_magazine_1928.]

Rarely made visible in the content of the magazines themselves, women were there at every stage in the process of their production, from the chemical supply houses to the newsdealers, even if Gernsback can't conceptualize this contribution as anything more than the circuits that connect and regulate all of the magazine's material inputs and outputs.^[For a history of the influential role women played in periodical publishing throughout the nineteenth century, see @harris_blue_2004.]

Given the potential diversity within the overlapping communities of wireless amateurism and later science fiction fandom, Gernsback's techno-utopianism seems somewhat empty.  To what end was this future progressing, and who got to make decisions about the direction it took?  In many ways, Gernsback's faith in the ceaseless advance of technological progress (he would write in **Wonders of the Machine Age** that "science fiction is based upon the progress of science; that is its very foundation.  Without it, there could be no science fiction") makes his late flirtation with the short-lived political movement of Technocracy seem inevitable.  Technocracy blossomed in the United States during the Depression with its plan to put engineers and skilled technologists in charge of the government.  While American socialists were reading Marx, the Technocrats took their inspiration from Thorstein Veblen, the American sociologist who advocated in *The Engineers and the Price System* (1921) for a more equitable form of price management through what he called a "Soviet of Technicians."  These engineers and technically educated managers would be able to govern more effectively the production and equal distribution of energy, goods, and quality of life than capitalist bureaucrats or politicians were capable.  His ideas were picked up by Howard Scott, a leading figure in the movement who formed Technocracy Inc., an organization whose "militaristic demeanor, its rigid hierarchal structure, its special insignia, its special salute, its grey uniforms, and its fleet of grey automobiles" raised the eyebrows of more than a few observers during fascism's spread across Europe.[^wbxo]

[^wbxo]: @segal_technological_2005, p. 123.  Harold Loeb, another leading proponent, headed up the rival Continental Committee on Technocracy and wrote the utopian roadmap *Life in a Technocracy: What it Might Be Like* (1933), a book that advocated a theory of value based on units of energy.  For Howard Segal, Technocracy and other associated efforts to forge a better society through technology (e.g. the New Machine, the Technical Alliance, the Utopian Society of America) marked a shift in the 1920s and 30s in utopian thinking from the possible to the probable.  For more on the Technocracy movement, see @bell_veblen_1991 \[1963\];  @akin_technocracy_1977.

Gernsback's short-lived *Technocracy Review* attempted to serve as a forum for the exchange of Technocratic ideas.  This bimonthly magazine lasted only for two issues, and Gernsback himself attempted to remain entirely neutral in its pages save for the argument that machines have throughout history created more jobs than they have taken.[^bn2i]  But Gernsback's career-long project to provide a complete education in science and technical principles for the masses was fundamentally incompatible with Technocracy, in which there was absolutely no place for public participation.  As Langdon Winner describes it, 

> In the technocratic understanding, the real activity of governing can have no place for participation by the masses of men.  All of the crucial decisions to be made, plans to be formulated, and actions to be taken are simply beyond their comprehension.  Confusion and disorder would result if a democratic populace had a direct voice in determining the course the system would follow.  Science and technics, in their own workings and in their utility for the polity, are not democratic, dealing as they do with truth on the one hand and optimal technical solutions on the other.^[@winner_autonomous_1978, p. 146.]

[^bn2i]:  The argument is developed in **Wonders of the Machine Age.**  The inaugural issue of the *Technocracy Review* (February 1933) contained articles by Howard Scott ("Technocracy Speaks"), Paul Blanshard ("A Socialist Looks at Technocracy"), William Z. Foster ("Technocracy and Communism"), and Gernsback's assistant editor David Lasser ("Technocracy---Hero or Villain?").

Though Gernsback tried not to be overtly political, and he rarely formulated his positions as such, his gestures toward community participation, grassroots education, and social mobility were anything but apolitical.  Sometimes this simply meant taking a step back from the bleeding edge of increasingly corporate innovation.  Throughout **Radio for All,** a book designed to transform a novice readership into a polity of wirelessly connected citizens, Gernsback purposefully uses what were by then slightly outmoded (and thus simpler to understand) components in all of his examples.  Daniel Czitrom describes this approach to educating a new public in the very technology that would constitute their awareness of themselves *as* a public as Gernsback's "hardware socialism."^[@czitrom_dialectical_1987.]  At other times, this meant promising that anyone, even an immigrant with no professional credentials and little formal education like himself, could produce inventions that were beneficial to social progress for all.  "Gernsback’s electric futurism was a variation on progressive thought," writes Eric Drown.^[@drown_usable_2001, p. 81-2.]  Above all, Gernsback was determined, in the words of Andrew Ross, that *science* "would not be associated with exclusive rhetorical idioms or with obfuscatory accounts of the object world by over-accredited experts.  For Gernsback, scientific language was a universal language of progress that ought to be accessible even to those without a college degree."^[@ross_strange_1991, p. 111.]

Unfortunately, the rapid progress so valued by Gernsback in the electrical arts ended up rendering obsolete the circuits of amateur cooperation and frugal ingenuity he helped institute.  By the 1920s, large corporations hoarded patents with the support of the federal government, research and development became an increasingly formalized institution, and these hybrid public/private entities were able to draw on capital that no independent amateur could hope to compete with.  Gernsback's picture of popular scientific education and homespun innovation weren't always able to adapt quickly enough.  Of course, not everyone could transform themselves into an Edison, Marconi, or Tesla.  But the truth of what amateur experimenters were actually capable of is often more interesting than Gernsback's incongruous fantasy of socially contingent, lone genius inventors.
