"'phone and code"

=================================

Can combine categories of TV, wireless, and "media" here, because TV never really developed as a community for Gernsback.  He started *Television News* as a wager to the argument that communities of amateurs can advance a "new art" faster than any closed off, patent-hoarding corporation.  That may be true, but the corporations dictated the terms of that development.  So, this section can be more broadly about Gernsback's understanding of media history, and how new media develop within communities.

what does it mean to communicate while in motion?  why was this something that people strived for? -- radio kinetics -- that moving humanity will now be connected with stationary humanity (find this quote?)

SF or 90s media theory?

--------------------------------

A number of quotes in the intro. And play a game: science fiction or 90s media theory?  Some of the following quotes are taken from works of science fiction, and others from works of 1990s media theory.  Can you tell which is part of which genre?  Goes to show the common threads of both SF and media theory, the way works in both genres from the 90s seem so similar.

"We are constantly being speeded up mentally" (Are We Intelligent) by Gernsback reads like a line right out of The Gutenberg Galaxy.  That our sensory environments are too packed, too distracting, and we need a better medium to communicate to the masses through because of this.

radio history / media archaeology

-------------------------------------------

> *Later works that read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of radio and television.*

In Gernsback's editorials, media history is evoked not merely as a nostalgic trip back to the devices of yesteryear, as it often is today in retro-kitsch, but as an archive of possibilities ripe for future experimentation. For instance, in a 1927 editorial ("Radio Steps Out"), at a moment when national broadcast networks were flickering to life and music and variety programs were flooding the country, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people's minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology. Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying wireless telegraphy became "radio," an everyday part of household furniture, Gernsback writes, "the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy. … There is hardly any industry today that cannot make use of radio instruments in some phase of its work."

His examples range from a force-field like burglar alarm, to automating the recording of lightning strikes, from measuring the minute weight and touch of a fly to scanning factory workers for stolen metals. And, in a forgotten example of Gernsback's own from the 1900s (which he christened the "Dynamophone") electric motors can be started remotely by the human voice, proving that "the apparatus foreshadowed broadcasting: the human voice actually did create effects at the receiving end," both for machines and humans.  Gernsback consistently reminds us that the inherent abilities of wireless, i.e. of information transmitted through the air, has now itself been scattered by the winds of technological evolution and inflects our understanding of and interaction with a fantastic number of techniques, technologies, and media.

television and community experimentation

-------------------------------------------------------

definitely use, then delete or rephrase from 193107 Television Technique:

[^rqrn]: Gernsback's first editorial for this magazine emphasized a slightly different point: that the large corporations---who by necessity had to be depended on to produce these incredibly complex and expensive technologies---were actually stifling competition by "jealously guarding whatever improvements are made, because these large firms naturally wish to come out with a complete set that can be sold ready-made to the public."  Continuing his argument that communities of amateur tinkerers, openly sharing their results, were a necessary element in the development of new media, Gernsback continues:

    > Everyone knows that, the more people who are working on an art, the more rapid the progress will be in the end.  Many improvements in radio have been due to experimenters who started in a small way and, later on, became outstanding figures in radio. … The more experimenters and the more television fans who become interested in the art, the quicker it will advance and the sooner it will be put on the stable basis which it deserves.

    

    He saw *Television News* as providing an entry point for this community of amateur television experimenters that had yet to come into being:  "To this purpose I am dedicating this new publication, and the future will demonstrate the correctness of the assumption."

media evolution

-------------------------

In a September 1926 article, he makes a striking media historical analogy between the threat of radio broadcasting to phonograph manufacturers, and that of the “eliminator” (a lighter, more portable, and rechargeable source of power developed in the mid-20s) to battery manufacturers. In Gernsbackʼs model of the historical “cycles” that the tech industry goes through, competing methods of delivering media— whether the medium is electricity or audio—do not replace but rather force one another to find their own unique attributes, simply as a matter of survival. In his media historical writings, Gernsback often speaks of the “perfection” of an apparatus, a question of medium specificity he almost always raises through the lens of viable business models.

“Coming Developments in Radio”

“…in which the Editor points out that there have not been any revolutionary improvements in radio and it is likely there will not be any; wherein it is shown why lectures and talks of more than 15 minutes’ duration are not popular; in which this is analysed; that the reason for it is the static ‘mush’ sound background, making listening difficult; and how it is hoped that in a few years this deficiency will be overcome…”

* * * on media evolution:  “It is this process of slow evolution that we may expect in the future, as well, and the old adage also holds true in radio: “Natura non facit saltum”—which, translated, says that Nature does not make jumps.  In other words, all developments are part of a slow-moving plan of evolution.  Even revolutionary inventions, when they do come along, will be found in the end to be not half as great a departure as they were thought to be at first.” @evolution

Actually tempers boosterish or wide-eyed furor or excitement over new technologies:  when broadcasting first initiated, “It was foretold, on all sides, that every school would have radio outfits installed, by means of which the pupils would be instructed by lectures from a central place, where some men of great eminence would lecture, so that the classes all over the country would get the same information simultaneously.”  @futurism

From **Edison and Radio**:  Platonic forms:  “The radio industry today is only five years old, and it may safely be predicted that when it becomes as old as the phonograph is today we shall hardly be able to recognize it as the same development.  It is admitted that radio is not yet perfect.  Neither is the phonograph, nor the automobile, or motion pictures, nor electric lights; nor, for that matter, a pair of shoes.”
