"'phone and code": Wireless, Television, and Other Emerging Media

=======================================================

Guillory:  "As we shall see, the extrapolation of a process of mediation from the fact of a particular communicative medium (speech, writing, print) depended not on the incorporation of the concept of medium into a more general conceptual framework but the reverse, a reduction of the social totality to communication as its representative in- stance."  @guillory_genesis_2010, 344

SF or 90s media theory?

--------------------------------

Thinking about both the rapidly evolving media that shape how we communicate with one another and understand the world, as well as the magazine itself as a medium capable of keeping up with these developments.

A number of quotes in the intro. And play a game: science fiction or 90s media theory?  Some of the following quotes are taken from works of science fiction, and others from works of 1990s media theory.  Can you tell which is part of which genre?  Goes to show the common threads of both SF and media theory, the way works in both genres from the 90s seem so similar.

"We are constantly being speeded up mentally" (Are We Intelligent) by Gernsback reads like a line right out of The Gutenberg Galaxy.  That our sensory environments are too packed, too distracting, and we need a better medium to communicate to the masses through because of this.

**Are We Intelligent,** cites the information overload for everyday people w/ modern technology, and that S&I is designed to match the speed with which people disseminate information now.  A very familiar sounding approach now, with digestible news stories and the time to read listed in the header, etc.  Magazine as a medium for educating an overwhelmed public.  Nice closing gesture to today, and the speed at which Gernsback's ideas moved.

media evolution

-------------------------

Where do new media come from?

a sense that media "evolve" according to their own logic.

In **Is Radio at a Standstill?,* he makes a striking media historical analogy between the supposed threat that the rise of radio broadcasting posed to established phonograph manufacturers, and the impact of the “eliminator” (a lighter, more portable, and rechargeable source of power developed in the mid-20s) to conventional battery manufacturers.  In the model that Gernsback outlines here of the historical cycles that the technology industry goes through, competing formats---whether the medium is electricity or audio---do not replace but rather force one another to find their own unique attributes, simply as a matter of survival.  In his media historical writings, Gernsback often speaks of the "perfection" of an apparatus, a question of medium specificity he almost always raises through the lens of viable business models.  Despite his penchant for projecting far-flung futures, Gernsback was often remarkably conservative when it came to the specifics of precisely how long such perfection would take, and what it would mean for developments in emerging media like wireless (later radio) and television.  Given the small sample size of these very young histories, there was little the technologist had to go in in thinking about the stable, almost Platonic forms that would emerge from the still-underdetermined interaction between rapidly changing technologies and cultural forms.  As he writes in **Edison and Radio**:

> The radio industry today is only five years old, and it may safely be predicted that when it becomes as old as the phonograph is today we shall hardly be able to recognize it as the same development.  It is admitted that radio is not yet perfect.  Neither is the phonograph, nor the automobile, or motion pictures, nor electric lights; nor, for that matter, a pair of shoes.

In a move that is perhaps unexpected for a technofuturist like Gernsback, he frequently tempers what he saw as a boosterish furor over the rapid development of new technologies.  By 1927, radio was firmly cemented in American life as an everyday piece of household furniture.  Not only were radios rapidly spreading into homes across the country after the so-called "radio Christmas" of 1924, but the legislative frameworks that would determine the structure of American broadcasting were finally being hammered out.^["More than ten times the number of tube sets were manufactured in 1925 than just two years earlier, and four times as many speakers as in 1923."  @douglas_listening_1999, 78].  Despite this seemingly overnight explosion, Gernsback writes in 1927, “there have not been any revolutionary improvements in radio and it is likely there will not be any."  Instead, people should expect a long process of gradual refinement:

> It is this process of slow evolution that we may expect in the future, as well, and the old adage also holds true in radio: "Natura non facit saltum"---which, translated, says that Nature does not make jumps.  In other words, all developments are part of a slow-moving plan of evolution.  Even revolutionary inventions, when they do come along, will be found in the end to be not half as great a departure as they were thought to be at first.^[@gernsback_coming_1926.]

One possible move was to read current inventions in light of their not so distant precursors, profiling forgotten (and often quirky) paths not taken in the development of emerging media.  In many of Gernsback's editorials, the history of media is evoked not merely as a nostalgic trip back to the devices of yesteryear, but as an archive of possibilities ripe for future experimentation. For instance, in another 1927 editorial, at a moment when national broadcast networks were flickering to life and music and variety programs were flooding the country, the medium of radio had become a fixed idea in people's minds that papered over the inherent abilities of the underlying technology. Looking back on that strange trajectory in which the technology underlying wireless telegraphy became "radio," an everyday part of household furniture, Gernsback writes, "the public at large is not aware of the fact that the art of radio is used for hundreds of different purposes aside from broadcasting and telegraphy. … There is hardly any industry today that cannot make use of radio instruments in some phase of its work."^[@gernsback_radio_1927.]  His examples range from a force-field like burglar alarm, to automating the recording of lightning strikes, from measuring the minute weight and touch of a fly to scanning factory workers for stolen metals.  And, in a forgotten example of Gernsback's own from the 1900s (which he christened **The Dynamophone**) electric motors can be started remotely by the human voice, proving that "the apparatus foreshadowed broadcasting: the human voice actually did create effects at the receiving end," both for machines and humans.  Gernsback consistently reminds us that the inherent abilities of wireless, of information transmitted through the air, has now itself been scattered by the winds of technological evolution and inflects our understanding of and interaction with a fantastic number of techniques, technologies, and media.  This wasn't just a historiographical move.  In articles like **New Radio 'Things' Wanted,** Gernsback encouraged home experimenters to remix and retrofit old technologies in order to imagine what the next great advance in radio might look like.  Pieces like this both educated an expanding public on precisely how this technology worked, as well as sought out new paths forward that may have been overlooked.

Setting aside the seeming perversity of emerging media that allowed them to evolve as if according to their own internal logic, Gernsback elsewhere emphasizes the important role that communities of users played in developing these new cultural forms.  In this sense, the merits of one detector over another were far less important than the new kinds of connection they made possible.  

Gernsback's media theory of course doesn't constitute a rigorous, internally consistent philosophical system.  Writing two, sometimes three or more articles a month meant that he was firing off ideas as they came to him, shaping them into a brief article.  While it's not quite accurate to say these constitute contradictions in his thinking, since each position is picked up and discarded as utility required---a tinkerer's thought---Gernsback's positions on many topics don't always evolve with time as they fragment, and take up multiple perspectives on a single issue.

Which means that many of Gernsback's writings take up not only the material specificity of wireless, but in a quite different vein the ways in which it was an inherently ethereal medium.  In "the most inspiring example of the triumph of mind over matter" (**A Treatise on Wireless Telegraphy**), simple minerals like zinc and copper could be harnessed to transmit the self, live across the ocean.  "We are now on the threshold of the wireless era, and just beginning to rub our intellectual eyes, as it were" (**Wireless Association of America**).  Wireless promised constant contact between friends, family, and complete strangers regardless of location.  "The radiophone," he wrote using another short-lived name for radio *avant la lettre,* "will like moving humanity with the stationary one" (**The Future of Wireless**).^[Gernsback continues to use the term "radiophone" as late as 1923.]  In other words, using "wireless tele-mechanics," even people driving in automobiles could have a conversation with someone sitting at home.  In 1909, Gernsback began publishing an annual wireless *Blue Book* containing the names and call signs of amateur wireless operators around the country.  The announcement of this annual directory that promised more and more citizens of the ether popping up on the map with each passing year alongside his feature on sending and receiving wireless signals from Mars (**Signaling to Mars**) makes it seem as if soon, even Martians will be addressable in the *Blue Book.*  Less than a decade later, Gernsback could write that "In our big cities thousands of ears listen every minute of the day to what is going on in the vast ether-ocean" (**War and the Radio Amateur**).

In many ways, this poses a classic science fictional question: how can national borders remain in the face of a dawning global consciousness?  The answer, of course, is that these utopian dreams were themselves the product of an American public that emerged from the horrors of World War I seemingly unscathed.  What they didn't realize was that the network of large wireless relay towers whose signals were a popular draw for new and existing amateur listeners were themselves a product of the United States's nationalist ambitions in teh wake of the Spanish-American War.  Wireless at that time was seen as an important tool in networking and securing the public.  (See the annotations in "Wired Radio Versus Space Radio" for more on the strategic control of submarine cables after the Spanish-American War.)

* * * * * * communities

One wonders throughout his writings who was included and excluded by this community.  Gernsback himself is remarkably silent on all questions regarding race, gender, and class, perhaps in the hopes of not alienating any potential readers.  

Silberman:

> But those who enjoyed gabbing away could “chew the rag” with other hams for hours, employing a lexicon as witty and ritualized as the jargon of fandom. The culture of wireless was also a strict meritocracy where no one cared about what you looked like or how gracefully you deported yourself in public. If you knew how to set up a rig and keep it running, you were welcome to join the party.

> The society of hams also enabled shy introverts to study the protocols of personal engagement from a comfortable distance. “Through amateur radio . . . I’ve learned so much about communication between people. I’ve had the opportunity to observe and participate in the giving and getting process, which is what communication is all about,” recalled Lenore Jensen, who co-founded the Young Ladies’ Radio League in 1939 to encourage more women to join the conversation. By interacting with other hams over the airwaves, she learned to conduct herself in social situations gracefully and went on to become an actress celebrated for her performances in The Beverly Hillbillies, General Hospital, and Father Knows Best.

In fact, it's impressive the degree to which race and gender are absolutely invisible in almost all of Gernsback's writings, a kind of "white washing" that perhaps would only be possible for a male Jewish immigrant.

Though Gernsback seldom addressed women, his writers sometimes reported on women in wireless, with some very interesting examples.  Mexican war refugee, women's suffragists.

When not simply listening in, operating wireless telegraph sets afforded a degree of anonymity to women who otherwise would have been excluded from these conversations and various forms of activities (DXing, mischief, etc.).

Though it is indeed rare that women are made visible in the pages of these magazines except as occasional curiosities, a later editorial by Gernsback makes clear that they played a vital role at virtually every level of the magazine's production.  A 1928 issue of *Science of Invention* opens with a fanciful tale in which King Outis VII of Erehwon, a great fan of the magazine, visits the offices of Experimenter Publishing to witness how the magazine is made.  He meets with editors, artists, advertising staff, linotypers, compositors, proof-readers, the binding department, and photographers.  Following the supply chain even deeper, Gernsback introduces the King to the "chemical houses who furnished the chemicals for making the pulp and bleaching it," the coal mines that made possible the steam to make that sulphite pulp paper, even the hens that laid the eggs "used in the photo-engraving process to supply albumen."  When the King finally asks "who all the pretty girls were that had clustered together in one aggregation," 

> We informed him immediately that they were secretaries, stenographers and typists, as well as editors and proofreaders and many others who had directly to do with the production of the magazine.  The firm that did the composing had several dozen girls that performed various jobs in connection with the magazine.  The printer had a number of girls who were either bookkeepers or stenographers, through whose hands passed the bills for the magazine, and the same was true of practically every other industry connected with the production of the magazine.^[@gernsback_magazine_1928.]

Though women are rarely made visible in the content of these magazines themselves, they are there at every stage in the process of their production, from the graphite mines to the chemical supply houses to the newsdealers.  Women are the very circuits that connect and regulate all of the magazine's material inputs and outputs.^[For a history of the influential role women played in the history of periodical publishing throughout the nineteenth century, see @harris_blue_2004.]

Replicated on Mars, with Martian women part of a "Tos rod" correspondence technology in *Baron Münchausen.*  For some reason, direct thought transference needs a secretary to make a record of it.  A "sensitive recording mechanism" that is "in charge of a secretary" -- one would think he means in *the* charge of a secretary, but who knows.  the role of the female secretary in this procedure is strange.  the entire process is described as the product of a machine, a stylus.  nowhere does she come into the operation, unless she’s occluded by the passive voice…  “is always recorded,” “is carefully labeled and stored away.”^[@gernsback_scientific_2010, p. 137.]

amateur avant garde

--------------------------

What role did this community play?

A detente throughout the 1910s after the Radio Act is passed, wherein amateurs could still be seen as the avant garde.

Though HG and collaborators feel left out of the broadcast boom, Radio News is still a beacon for tinkerers around the world, who feel that their sets are far superior to the "average" sets sold by companies, in department stores, etc., and that they serve as the vanguard of advancing the "science."

The amateur avant garde:  

> The set builder naturally is well able to compete with the manufacturer, for two reasons. First, his time costs him little, and in price, therefore, he can compete easily with the factory-made set. Secondly, he has the jump on the manufactured set for the simple reason that, as like as not, his circuit is the latest out, and, therefore, will have improvements that the manufactured set can not boast for some months to come.(**Radio Enters a New Phase**)

But later, when the technology and the regulation of radio becomes too complicated for amateurs to follow, when WRNY is forced to shut down by the FCC because it's too small, we see a different track being taken, an archaeology of forgotten developments that are simpler, and can still prove useful.

These contradictions [extolling the virtues of the amateur and the tinkerer while being bankrolled by RCA and AT&T(?) advertising revenue] abounded in the pages of Gernsback’s publications.  

1925 Sept -- "General Harbord Explains the Patent Situation" 252+ president of RCA.  192509

The May 1920 issue (v8n1) described C.D. Wagoner, “The New Radio Corporation,” on the formation of RCA, and two years later, their ads were being run in HG publications:  “[RCA ad]” p. 877.  Science and Invention Jan 1922, v9n9  RCA ads in a Gernsback mag as early as Jan 1922.  “Listening to Broadcasted News and Music from the Radio Telephone.”  In bed with their money early on.  

From **Radio Enters Into a New Phase,** HG defends patents as a monopoly:  RCA holds a patent on virtually every important radio related invention.  Gernsback argues that every patent is a monopoly.  Any small set manufacturer has to pay expensive royalties, phasing out all but the largest firms.  G is strangely optimistic about this possibility:  “What has been predicted for a number of years has thus come to pass.  The radio set business will be in the hands of a few strong corporations, which will control the legitimate set business in the United States on a highly competitive basis.  All other reports to the contrary, this certainly is not a general monopoly of the set business; and we believe that, in time to come, it will work out to the advantage of the public.”  But set manufacturers are slower to change than the experimenter.

As Tim Wu argues, Radio News even served as one of the first broadcast programming guides in the country’s history, publishing lists of each radio station in operation, along with their frequencies and “what one might expect to hear on them—a forerunner of the once hugely profitable TV Guide” (39)  What these lists reveal is that much of the chatter on the air as early as 1922 came from corporate sources:  “many early stations were run by radio manufacturers such as Westinghouse, the pioneer of the ready-to-plug-in model [a claim Gernsback would certainly dispute], and RCA, botho f which had an obvious interest in promoting the medium.  Still many stations were run by amateurs, ‘radio clubs,’ universities, churches, hotels, poultry farms, newspapers, the U.S. Army and Navy” (39).

The example of the lists (apparently published many times in Radio News?) cited by Wu is Armstrong Perry, “What Anyone Can Hear: Complete List of Broadcasting Stations in U.S.”  March 1922, 814.

“[RCA ad]” p. 877.  Science and Invention Jan 1922, v9n9  RCA ads in a Gernsback mag as early as Jan 1922.  “Listening to Broadcasted News and Music from the Radio Telephone.”  In bed with their money early on.

In the **Radio Broadcasting** issue, another article by Mrs. Christine Frederick, “The Radiophone Now a Household Necessity”

Gernsback, “Radio Town Crier”, illustration of a massive skyscraper that broadcasts audio news, in v11n10 192402

G., “The Garrett Inventor” v15n11, 192803 — “It was pointed out, in all sincerity, that no great inventions could possibly come from the small inventor in the future.” …  “The story sounded plausible enough, because in all of the laboratories of our large industrial companies, research scientists are busy, day and night, in inventing and perfecting new devices.”  Gives examples of how this is not the case. 

“By July 1928 … Gernsback was convinced that experimenter culture existed only as an ideal.  He had been running a monthly contest that rewarded radio constructors for ‘novel and practical sets’ (“Radio News Monthly Prize”).  But too many entries featured only hackneyed old ideas or worse, no sign of practical development at all.  By January 1929, Gernsback killed the contest in palpable disgust for the people who called themselves experimenters (“End of Monthly).”  (Drown 100) 

Andrew Ross:  “Industrial corporations either controlled or purchased most invention patents, hoarding them in order to suppress competition, while independent inventors lacked the big capital that was increasingly required for research and development of their alternative technologies.  As a result, the explosive age of industrial invention lay in the past, viewed as much too volatile in its effects for the scientifically regulated process of production favored by monopoly capitalism.  The new emphasis on control, precision, uniformity, predictability, and standardization meant the extinction of the entrepreneur-inventor, whose heyday had included the likes of George Westinghouse, Francis Richards, Edward Weston, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Lee De Forest, Elihu Thomson, Charles Brush, Charles Hall, Edward Dean Acheson, and Elmer Sperry.  While scientists became increasingly ‘proletarianized,’ the new Fordist compromise meant that monopoly cartels, often in agreement with labor unions, would seek new uses for old technology rather than risking the potential instability offered by new labor-saving, and ecologically sound, technologies.” (124)

“the number of decreasing dealers selling radio parts went from 30,000 during the radio boom [c. 1922] to around 2500 at the end of 1926.” Massie and Perry

television and community experimentation

-------------------------------------------------------

definitely use, then delete or rephrase from 193107 Television Technique:

[^rqrn]: Gernsback's first editorial for this magazine emphasized a slightly different point: that the large corporations---who by necessity had to be depended on to produce these incredibly complex and expensive technologies---were actually stifling competition by "jealously guarding whatever improvements are made, because these large firms naturally wish to come out with a complete set that can be sold ready-made to the public."  Continuing his argument that communities of amateur tinkerers, openly sharing their results, were a necessary element in the development of new media, Gernsback continues:

> Everyone knows that, the more people who are working on an art, the more rapid the progress will be in the end.  Many improvements in radio have been due to experimenters who started in a small way and, later on, became outstanding figures in radio. … The more experimenters and the more television fans who become interested in the art, the quicker it will advance and the sooner it will be put on the stable basis which it deserves.

He saw *Television News* as providing an entry point for this community of amateur television experimenters that had yet to come into being:  "To this purpose I am dedicating this new publication, and the future will demonstrate the correctness of the assumption."^[@gernsback_television_1931.]

Mixing up sensory inputs: television signals become tacticle and auditory sensation.  Media are synonymous with the mechanical transportation and simulation of sensory inputs.

“An interesting phenomenon in connection with television itself is that, if the output currents of the light-sensitive cell are listened to in a telephone receiver, they can be heard as sounds, and every object or scene has its own peculiar characteristic sound.  For example, the fingers of a hand held in front of the transmitter will give rise to a sound similar to the grating of a very coarse file, while the human face will cause a high-pitched whistle which will vary in pitch as the head is turned or even when the features are moved.  For experimental purposes Mr. Baird had some phonograph records made of the sounds made by different persons’ faces, and by listening carefully to the reproductions of these records it is possible to distinguish between one face and another by the sounds they make!  With practice, faces may even be recognized by the sounds produced.”^[@dinsdale_television_1927]

lifting from Edison patent language on cinema/phonograph:  “To the layman who does not as yet know what television is, I may say that the term describes an electrical process, whereby it is possible to see at a distance and to view distant events as they are taking place.  In this way television does for the eye what the telephone does for the ear.  Your friend, using the telephone, talks to you from his office, while you are sitting in yours; while the television process is comparable in that you will see your friend as he is talking to you, and, vice versa, he will see you.”^[@gernsback_television_1927]
