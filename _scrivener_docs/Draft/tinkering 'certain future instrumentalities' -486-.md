"certain future instrumentalities" ^[193212_reasonableness_in_sf]

[Along with regulation/social ideology, can serve as a pivot between wireless activities and SF?]

overarching story

------------------

The Electro Importing company's "main factory and office building at 233 Fulton Street," which is now the site of Ground Zero and the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.  Gernsback's private laboratory was on the fifth floor, "and the room abounds with bottles of all sizes, graduates, hydrometers, voltmeters and ammeters, crucibles, et cetera."  Working together in the main laboratory are Sidney Gernsback and H.W. Secor.  "…the Company makes practically all its own radio instruments, including telephone and wireless head 'phones."  @_e._1915.

Immediately after launching *Modern Electrics,* Gernsback writes to luminaries in the field, requesting articles and interviews.  To Edison, 3.28.09: "The writer believes you to be interested in the propagation of the electrical arts among the Young and as MODERN ELECTRICS is devoted exclusively to young people the writer hopes that his step will find approval by the Master of Electricity."

Takes place between the machine shop model of innovation w/ the telegraph, according to Paul Israel (an age that some mythologize as the era of the independent inventor) and its transition, thanks largely to Edison, to corporate R&D (which many also mythologize as being solely the province of scientists disconnected from practical innovation, when in fact there was a great deal of small-scale tinkering, and, according to Hintz, independent inventors lived on).

(from 192302: [^keq]: Though Gernsback is obviously trying to stir up his readership, this article touches on a very real anxiety about the role of the amateur in a world of increasingly professionalized engineering and invention. But historian of technology Eric S. Hintz argues that despite commonly accepted wisdom, independent inventors continued to be a source of viable innovations well into the twentieth century, when corporate research and development was gradually beginning to take on greater importance. Well after the "heroic" era of inventors like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell:)

"The amateur's work is valuable."  from Grundy's letter on who will save the radio amateur 192302 -- not just blind tinkering, but "work."

What begins as an objective description of a new wireless component seems to eventually boil down to a product pitch.  Indeed, the Radioson would be advertised for sale from the Electro Importing Company in competitor's publications in the coming months.  But the level of detail Gernsback goes into here is unique, making this essay not just a product announcement, but a detailed discussion of how the device is constructed and why:

> Detectors and detector theory did not develop in smooth and rational progression, but in the usual fascinatingly wayward manner associated with most human activities. Only on rare occasions did researchers describe their technology with clarity. Moreover, commercial competition meant that there often was a great deal of secrecy about technical details. @thackeray_when_1983

One wonders then who Gernsback is pitching this device to, and why.  If this is such a valuable advance in radio technology, and if Gernsback was truly the obsessive profit-seeker that SF historians like to claim he is, why would he share blueprints for his design?  Why make this public and allow any experimenter to reproduce the results he's achieved?  Did he already try to pitch this to companies and they turned it down because, obviously, a Radioson detector can't be more powerful than the Audion?  Perhaps it is the best possible version:  that Gernsback was on to something, and he thought the best way for ideas travel is to share them, make them public, allow others to "fork" or "version" his hardware so that the idea grows faster that way.  Was this a possible model of collective tinkering before corporatized R&D and professional engineering?

Mineral proficiencies:

(Originally a fn in **A Treatise on Wireless**, link to it for more on what precisely molybdenite is, and how amateurs played with chemicals.)  One has to wonder about the experience not only of communicating in private, perhaps in secret, through code and the intimacy of a headset, but also of the mineral proficiencies, the material awareness these amateurs had of their apparatus.  News from New York may become audible to a rural midwesterner if only he could find some molybdenite, or a supplier willing to ship him the nitric acid needed to try out a new electrolytic detector.  

Images such as these seem especially especially poignant in light of recent calls for a critical awareness of the mining of rare earth minerals used in today's increasingly complex digital devices, and the environmental toll of electronic waste once we inevitably replace these devices for new ones.  Jussi Parikka writes of materiality in terms of a "persistance that lingers across scales from minerals and chemical elements to the lungs and organic tissue."  He continues:  "The device is enabled by dubious labor practices, including child labor in the mines of Congo; the appalling working conditions, which lead to a number of scuicides in the Foxconn factories in China; and the planned obsolescence designed into the product which also contributes to its weight share of electronic waste problems." @parikka_dust_2013  See also Timothy Morton's recent work on what he calls "hyperobjects": things that "do not rot in our lifetimes.  They do not burn without themselves burning (releasing radiation, dioxins, and so on).  The ecological thought must think the future of these objects, these toxic things that appear almost more real than reality itself, like the acidic blood of the Alien in Ridley Scott's film, which burns through metal floors."  @morton_ecological_2012, p. 130.

interested in the material possibility of inventions before they are an idea.  See 191608_perversity and… (fn text: media theorists have attempted to come up with a language for the idea of something before it's material possibility, citing Bazin)

how does one develop the inventor's intuition?  by learning about materials and process.  each technique involves the learning of countless other techniques. "Handicraft," quoted in fn for 192702_why_set_builder.

links from Henry on popular scientific education here.  While Gernsback talks about sci edu more in the scientifiction section than tinkering, this is a good place to bring up these themes in the intro, esp. if i'm not directly tying each intro section to organizational "themes" of the book.  So, what role does the tinkerer have between 19thC and institutionalized science?  And, contextualize push for public science education in the US

see prologue to Aitken, Syntony and Spark on invention as a kind of guessing, separate from science, a blind creativity.

From a footnote to possibly move:  [^fns]: In an editorial for *Science and Invention* titled "Handicraft" and published in the same month as this piece, Gernsback advocates for the importance of making things as a hobby for the white collar worker.  Tinkering isn't just a means of diversion or release after the working day is over, it serves as an education in tools, materials, and techniques.  For Gernsback, the know-how that emerges from the experience of making things is cascading: hands gradually feeling their way along an interlocking series of dependent skills and material properties.  (From 192702 Why the Radio Set Builder, an important piece)

## Tinkering and technology

> *Reports on broadcast experiments at Gernsback's WRNY radio station, new inventions developed at the Electro Importing Company labs, and critical essays on techniques for thinking creatively through technology.*

Gernsback oversaw experiments with broadcast media and the effects of various instruments and signal processing techniques on the auditory perception of the station's listeners from his radio station WRNY.  Several articles and editorials cover these experiments, including a concert broadcasting some of some of the earliest electronic instruments developed at the E.I. Company offices ("The Pianorad") as well as one of the earliest television broadcasts on record, using a unique method of interleaving audio and visual signals across a single frequency ("Television and the Telephot").  Gernsback championed the creativity and problem-solving abilities of the tinkerer throughout his career ("Why the Radio Set Builder"; "Is Radio at a Standstill?")

While conducting these groundbreaking experiments, Gernsback kept these developments open to the contributions and participation of his readers.  In one editorial for *Radio News*, ("Television to the Front") Gernsback describes the television as just a simple add-on or expansion kit to a normal domestic radio set.  "I am quite certain that the final television apparatus on your radio set will take up no more room than your present cone speaker."  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of Gernsback's magazines seemed—solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes—his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appear as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one can pick and choose from out of the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog*.

Edison on atomic technology:  "You know, Mr. Gernsback, I am an inventor, and as such I do not concern myself overmuch with philosophical research."  What Gernsback does as "philosophy" about future possibilities.

John Taggart from a 1999 book of poems: "Technique is the way art means, and sometimes it thinks back, meaning more than we meant it to mean."

I have seen many different editions of these magazines in various archives, academic and private, and seen many scans available in various places online.  Many of the issues have scribbles in the margins, newspaper articles and other ephemera attached between the pages.  An active readership, working out problems, solving problems, thinking actively.

1916 May -- "Edison Says You are a 'Mucker'!"  15 (anon) -- term of endearment for all scientific experimenters.  "Are you an electrical Experimenter?  Yes?  Well, in that case you are a 'MUCKER'!  A plain, common, ordinary, everyday mucker!!  So says one Thomas Alva Edison, and if the 'Wiz' says so it must be true.  You say you don't like to be called such names?  It's a distinction to be called a mucker.  Edison says he is am mucker himself.  Says all scientific experimenters are muckers.  So there!" @experimentation

* * * Thomas Reed, “The Unterrified Amateur” — on a reader who asks how to build an audion tube, the symbol of corporate produced, untinkerable electronics.  Writes with awe as the boy goes out and learns about glassblowing — he probably never makes it but that’s not the point 

Readers ask “The Oracle,” for instance, if a long and low horizontal aerial would be better than a high vertical one, or how many feet are in a pound of “No. 12 B.&S. triple braided weather proof wire,” and whether or not two lead plates soaked in a solution of sulphuric acid would make a good storage battery.  in the v1n4 190807 issue of ME

Don't even have to use the technologies, if you can't afford them.  Reading a form of experimentation:  1923 Feb -- Letter.  1434.  Stephens, Richard J.  "You can better realize what these magazines mean to me when I say that I seldom, if ever, get a chance to have the material to experiment with, so I must content myself with reading matter, and I do like to read, especially such a wealth of material as is combined in the pages of your three publications."  That the readers can think of themselves as experimenters while reading… "as long as Gernsback addressed his readers in semi-technical terms." (Drown 91)

v12n12 192504: G, “Radio and the Student”  —  “A radio set builder must be a carpenter, an electrican, a metal worker, a tinsmith, and a radio engineer, all rolled into one.” 

v14n10 192702 - G, “Handicraft” — again, using this term “knack.”
