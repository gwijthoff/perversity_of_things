"certain future instrumentalities”: Tinkering, Making, and Mineral Proficiencies

======================================================

In *Electrical Experimenter's* January 1916 "Wrinkles, Recipes, and Formulas" section, amid a recipe for writing fluid and instructions for a homemade heliograph printing process, there appears a curious piece by Gernsback that recommends the reader try biting a sewing needle tightly between his teeth while holding the sharp end to the groove of a phonograph record:

> With a little practise one will become proficient in moving the head at the same ratio of speed as the ordinary reproducer arm is moved from the outside of the record towards the inside. As soon as the needle touches the record with sufficient pressure, the inside of the head will be filled immediately with music exceedingly loud and clear. A curious result of the experiment is that a person standing near by can bear the music, the head acting as a reproducer in this case.  (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**)^[This author, having successfully performed the experiment himself, for legal reasons probably shouldn't recommend that the reader try this at home.]

The experiment may have seemed familiar to those who had just read the latest installment of Gernsback's *The Scientific Adventures of Baron Münchausen* earlier that issue, in which a very strange Martian technology known as the Tos Rod is described, which allows the Martians to hear "not with their ears. They were listening with their brains!"

> The two reddish plates pressing against the bare temples are made of two metals unknown on earth, and the metals are distributed over the surface of the plate in honeycomb fashion without touching each other. Now if the two plates are pressed against the temples and when wireless waves are passing through them, the waves are translated into vibrations of a certain frequency. It has been found that if these vibrations reach the conscious sense of hearing which is located in the *Temporal Lobe* of the brain, sounds can be impressed upon the brain without requiring the ear and its auditory nerve. In other words, the sound is "heard" directly within the brain without the agency of the ear's mechanism.

Martians in mind, the reader could now have a felt sense of the operative principle behind this alien technology thanks to the sewing needle experiment:  that the ear itself is not "absolutely essential for hearing."  This is just one of many examples of how, throughout the Gernsback magazines, tinkering with something as simple as available household materials became the starting point for new inventions, both functional and fictional.  Gernsback would in fact patent a device he called the Osophone seven years later, a "small, compact and handy instrument which can be easily carried about and used without attracting undue attention."  The Osophone employed the same principle as the *Electrical Experimental* editorial, this time with a finished mouthpiece attached to a wire that provided a "simple and practical means by which hearing may be effected by sound vibrations transmitted directly to the osseous tissue of the body."^[@gernsback_acoustic_1924.]  Projecting out from these available materials and describing their experience in the future was a means of aiding design practice.  And it was due to the perspective of the future that Gernsback developed his tinkerer's ethic.

What did it mean to be a tinkerer in the 1910s and 20s?  The appellation was variable.  Gernsback himself used *tinkerer, experimenter,* and *amateur,* while Edison preferred *mucker.*^["'A mucker is an experimenter -- a scientific experimenter,' Mr. Hutchinson explained.  'Mr. Edison is a mucker himself.  He call all experimenters muckers.'  It was explained that Mr. Edison had been president of a muckers club.  So there you are, muckers!"  @_edison_1916.]  Today, we might refer to these people who took pride in their ability to build seemingly complex technologies from scratch as *makers.*  Not just a hobby, tinkering in the early twentieth century was a special form of intuition or creativity, a means of advancement for a self-educated working class, as well as a political position against the increasingly complex and unreliable consumer technologies produced by corporations like RCA and AT&T.  Throughout his editorials on technology in the older, Aristotelian sense of "a reasoned state of capacity to make," Gernsback argued that the incremental modification associated with a term like *tinkering* involved just as much creative expression, expertise, and skill as the whole cloth production of a new technology we might associate with *invention.*^[@_nicomachean_2009, 105.]  

Across Europe, political circumstances in the wake of World War I led some amateur radio groups to become highly politicized, as was the case with the *Arbeiterradio-Bewegung* (Workers' Radio Movement) in Germany.  What began as "a loose assocation of amateurs who wanted to learn how to build their own apparatus so that they could transmit and receive radio messages themselves" soon grew into a radical movement operating in an environment of high unemployment and growing government repression.  Associated with this movement and its publications like *Der neu Rundfunk* [New Radio], *Arbeiter-Funk* [Workers' Radio], and *Unser Sender* [Our Radio Station], were Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, Paul Hindemeith, and Kurt Weill.

> They began to criticise the programmes of established radio broadcasting and presented their own suggestions for organising the medium according to their interests, organised evenings for collective listening (particuarly to Soviet radio stations), and protested about censorship of programmes.^[@zielinski_audiovisions:_1999, p. 126-7.]

While tinkering never evolved into a coherent political position in the United States, its practitioners nevertheless saw themselves as advocates of what we might think of today as "free culture," both by operating in opposition to the hoarding of intellectual property by corporate interests and in freely sharing their knowledge and skills.  Forms of self-education during the period varied widely according to class.  While middle class Americans were now able to culturally enrich themselves during their leisure time through several new "great book" series geared toward mass audiences, like the Book of the Month Club and the Harvard Classics "Five Foot Shelf" collection, the urban working classes "were asked to invest their sense of self in hands-on technical knowledge," writes Eric Drown.  Commercial technical institutes and correspondence schools promised upward mobility and job security within a number of growing fields like automobile repair and electrical engineering, in addition to radio.^[@drown_usable_2001, p. 77-78.  @rubin_making_1992.]  Companies began selling products that allowed young men to learn electrical principles at home:

> Parents eager to set their children on the right path bought them chemistry sets with names like Chemcraft, produced by the Porter Chemical Company, which also sponsored Chemists Clubs.  Young adult books on electricity and technology flourished, many of them written for boys and intended to instill the noble desire to invent. . . . This was certainly a far cry from the genteel instruction on natural philosophy to promote polite drawing room conversation on scientific theory published just a few decades earlier.  It’s interesting to consider just what a young Michael Faraday would make of such a book or of *Harper’s Electricity Book for Boys* (1907) in which the author, Joseph H. Adams, wrote: "Theory is all very well, but there is nothing like mastering principles, and then applying them and working out results for one's self."^[@schlesinger_battery:_2011, p. 200-1.  Schlesinger adds an amateur experimenter culture preceded Gernsback's magazines, noting that L. Frank Baum, author of *The Wizard of Oz,* wrote *The Master Key: An Electrical Fairy Tale,* in 1901, in which a young man sets out on "an electrical adventure with all manner of gadgets and gizmos that benefit mankind.  The book, as Baum noted in the preface, was "Founded Upon the Mysteries of Electricity and the Optimism of Its Devotees."]

* * * * * * * * * * * 

More importantly, during the period of such rapid change in radio manufacture we saw in the previous section, new applications of older technologies was a form of dissent for tinkerers.  Designs for cheaply-made, easy to reproduce components like **The Radioson Detector** could rival the newer, industrially produced vacuum tube sets by being cheaper, easier to fix, and most importantly, easily understood by most home experimenters.

machine shop / individual invention

-----------------------------------------------

Takes place between the machine shop model of innovation w/ the telegraph, according to Paul Israel (an age that some mythologize as the era of the independent inventor) and its transition, thanks largely to Edison, to corporate R&D (which many also mythologize as being solely the province of scientists disconnected from practical innovation, when in fact there was a great deal of small-scale tinkering, and, according to Hintz, independent inventors lived on).

A literature (Israel, Hintz) that troubles this transition between lone, independent inventors to collective, massively funded corporate research labs … and the HG articles take place in this moment, making it too easy to say that their readership was part of a dying breed, or that the transition to scientifiction magazines in the late 1920s was a product of this readership feeling left out of the community of invention, as we will discuss later.

"the rise of modern corporate-based industrial research laboratories in the twentieth century" @israel_machine_1992, 2

a parallel between this twentieth century transition and another moment in the nineteenth century with the rise of machine shops:  "In the place of many lone, independent inventors we begin to see a pattern of cooperative shop invention in which skilled operatives, superintendents, machinists, and manufacturers make up technological communities that draw on practical experience to design, build, and refine new technology." @israel_machine_1992, 2  Communicating through trade journals like *The Telegrapher* in the 1860s.

In this shop culture, "few inventors [working on the telegraph] actually worked alone and none worked in complete isolation.  Conceptualization was often stimulated by access to new information.  And the construction, testing, and redesigning of apparatus necessary for practical application almost invariably required an inventor to seek the assistance of others, whose own contributions often altered the original design.  The power of the popular heroic model of invention, which treats initial conceptualization as the true inventive act, has caused the more methodical activities involved in the development of a practical invention to often be treated as ancillary, thus obscuring the diversity of other contributions oftne necessary to the successful inventive enterprise." @israel_machine_1992, 57

As Hugh Aitken puts it, the most meaningful development in the emergence of radio -- the transition from spark gap sets to continuous wave transmission -- wasn't primarily a question of how science and technology defined themselves in relation to one another.  Rather, this transition happened "at the hazy boundary where radio stopped being a matter for visionary experimenters and started to become a hardheaded business capable of gaining and holding a commercial market."^[@aitken_continuous_1985, p. 9-10.]

(from 192302: [^keq]: Though Gernsback is obviously trying to stir up his readership, this article touches on a very real anxiety about the role of the amateur in a world of increasingly professionalized engineering and invention. But historian of technology Eric S. Hintz argues that despite commonly accepted wisdom, independent inventors continued to be a source of viable innovations well into the twentieth century, when corporate research and development was gradually beginning to take on greater importance. Well after the "heroic" era of inventors like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell:)

I have seen many different editions of these magazines in various archives, academic and private, and seen many scans available in various places online.  Many of the issues have scribbles in the margins, newspaper articles and other ephemera attached between the pages.  An active readership, working out technical issues, solving problems, thinking actively.

Don't even have to use the technologies, if you can't afford them.  Reading a form of experimentation:  1923 Feb -- Letter.  1434.  Stephens, Richard J.  "You can better realize what these magazines mean to me when I say that I seldom, if ever, get a chance to have the material to experiment with, so I must content myself with reading matter, and I do like to read, especially such a wealth of material as is combined in the pages of your three publications."  That the readers can think of themselves as experimenters while reading… "as long as Gernsback addressed his readers in semi-technical terms." (Drown 91)

Mineral proficiencies, rolling expertise

--------------------------------------------------

Gernsback devoted space in many of his editorials to thinking about the process by which "new things" come into the world, and the special forms of creativity that emerge when an inventor draws equally upon science and the arts to design a technology.  In many ways, he was far ahead of his time in proposing several frameworks for understanding invention, even if they were underdeveloped.  It wouldn't be for many years that the social and historical study of technology would be accepted as a serious academic pursuit, as Hugh Aitken writes in the 1976 prologue to his magisterial, two-volume history of radio:

> If the 'new things' of science, technology, and economic life often seem overwhelming and uncontrollable, the reason may well be that we have, in modern societies, created highly efficient structures for the generation of new knowledge without seriously attending to the processes by which new knowledge is put to use. . . . historians of the future will find it strange that so few social scientists of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.[^nwpn]

[^nwpn]: @aitken_syntony_1976, 9.  Aitken is citing here @merton_priorities_1957.

This is of course no longer the case, with the vibrant field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) beginning to have a great influence on a diverse number of disciplines.  But it's important to note here that the questions raised by Gernsback in a pulp publishing context wouldn't have sufficient answers even among academic historians and sociologists of technology for many decades to come.

Gernsback's views on these issues evolved over the years thanks in part to the debates, suggestions, and questions he and his staff printed in lively correspondence sections like The Oracle and Patent Advice.  Questions from readers ranged from the factual (how many feet come in a pound of No. 12 B.&S. triple-braided weather proof wire?) to the experimental (might two lead plates submerged in sulphuric acid make a good storage battery?).  It was important for knowledge to be freely shared among readers, contributors, and editors, since the construction of wireless sets involved many different forms of expertise.  "A radio set builder," wrote Gernsback in a 1925 editorial, "must be a carpenter, an electrician, a metal worker, a tinsmith, and a radio engineer, all rolled into one."^[@gernsback_radio_1925.]  Initially, Gernsback argued that such impressively skilled inventors were born, not made.  While many could learn to be "mechanical" inventors, or those "who are suddenly confronted with a certain device that to their minds seems imperfect, whereupon they will bend their energies towards improving the existing device," true inventors were hard to come by (**The Born and the Mechanical Inventor**).  In cultural studies of media and technology today, we might think of these two styles of invention as Gernsback formulates them -- the whole cloth innovation of shiny new tools versus incremental acts of modification and repair -- as reflections of a hemispheric divide.  Steven J. Jackson argues that "a Western and productivist imagination" biases much of media studies today, obscuring the vast majority of technological practices in the developing world:  "breakdown, maintenance, and repair constitute crucial but vastly understudied sites or moments within the worlds of new media and technology today."^[For more on "the distinctive repair ecologies of the developing world," see @jackson_rethinking_2014.]

Eventually, Gernsback began to shift his views on invention so that they were more in line with the educational goals of his magazines.  In **Why The Radio Set Builder,** we begin to understand that the biggest contributions to this community of makers were not necessarily made by its most broadly educated members.  To the contrary, the most important things that an experimenter needed to know would emerge organically from the process of tinkering, in a dialogue between a person and an inanimate object.  Gernsback advocated making things by hand not just as a hobby, a means of diversion or release after the working day is over (he seems in the below editorial to be addressing the white collar worker in particular), but as a complete education in tools, materials, and techniques:

> If, for instance, you are making an elaborate radio console for your living room, you will get more information on the subject than you could possibly get from the best text-books.  You will, first of all, become familiar with the various tools necessary to fashion the wood, and if you own a woodworking lathe you will learn quite a good deal about the operation of wood-turning and the tools to be used for this particular purpose.  You will learn what it means to sandpaper, you will learn to recognize the different kinds of wood, and you will know the difference between green and kiln-dried variety of woods.  You will soon know how to use glue, and what kind.  You will study the various fillers, and, last but not least, you will get a thorough education in varnishes and paints, and the use of all of these.^[@gernsback_handicraft_1927]

For Gernsback, the know-how that emerges from making things is cascading: hands gradually feeling their way along an interlocking series of dependent skills and material properties.  As we see in **The Perversity of Things,** objects only ever seem like frustrating "obstacles" in the way of a good idea when we don't fully understand the proper affordances of those objects.  "It is not the things that are perverse, it is ourselves who make them seem perverse."  With enough experience, barriers and constraints begin to look like creative opportunities.  Gernsback refers to this capacity to see finished form in raw materials as a "knack" or an "intuition."  It's what allows one reader to build an audion tube from scratch, that ultimate symbol of inscrutable corporate complexity, by learning glassblowing.^[@reed_unterrified_1916.]  Or another to make the first ever permanent recording of a radio broadcast by modifying his phonograph player so that it could register the signals from his wireless set.^[@apgar_amateur_1915.]  The more experience an experimenter had with a wide variety of materials and techniques, the better attuned his intuition would become when it came to making new devices.

Today, the intense material specificity of the technologies as they were described to the readers of these magazines is highly impressive.  In Gernsback's writings, one is struck not only by the romance of communicating in private through secret codes and the intimacy of a headset, but also by the exotic materials that made this experience possible.  Pieces like **The Dynamophone** and **A Treatise on Wireless Telegraphy** address a readership with an already impressive material awareness of their apparatus, and introduce new possibilities each month to the wireless medium's construction and operation.  Thanks to these mineral proficiencies, a rural midwestern reader would know that news from New York may become audible if only he could find some molybdenite, or a supplier willing to ship him the nitric acid needed to try out a new electrolytic detector.^[For more on molybdenite and how amateurs used it, see **A Treatise on Wireless**.]  The sheer alchemy that went into the construction of these apparatuses -- glass light bulbs filled with argon gas, impure silicon crudely fused into thin wafers, influential experiments conducted by an employee of AT&T with the contents of a "Minerals of Maine" souvenir box -- makes the effects they were able to achieve seem all the more wonderful.^[The "Minerals of Maine" box included iron pyrite, galena, chalcopyrite, and magnetite.  See @douglas_crystal_1981; @thackeray_when_1983.]

Details such as these seem especially poignant in light of recent calls for a critical awareness of the rare earth minerals used in the production of today's increasingly complex digital devices, as well as the environmental toll of the electronic waste these devices leave behind once we inevitably acquiesce to their fragility by replacing them with the latest release.  In an article on the dust produced during the manufacture and disposal of hardware, Jussi Parikka writes of a "persistence that lingers across scales from minerals and chemical elements to the lungs and organic tissue."^[@parikka_dust_2013.]  Timothy Morton refers to these persistent objects, often produced and disposed of under appalling working conditions in China and countries across Africa, as "hyperobjects":  manufactured materials or devices that "do not rot in our lifetimes.  They do not burn without . . . releasing radiation, dioxins, and so on."^[@morton_ecological_2012, p. 130.]  That gadgets like smartphones and tablets today are described as "magical" or like "touching the future" should come as no surprise.  Not only are they black boxes that with every passing year become increasingly difficult to modify, repair, or tinker with, they are blissfully disconnected from the labor practices and material conditions that go into producing them.  We encounter a very different kind of moment through Gernsback's writings.  Of course the emerging technology of wireless was pure magic:  it allowed people to skim disembodied voices from the air.  But wireless was magical to Gernsback's readers not because they didn't understand how the trick worked, but because they did.  That elemental, raw materials could produce such effects was absolutely fantastic, and provided an endless source of fascination.

![From left to right, Harry Winfield Secor and Sidney Gernsback, Hugo's brother.  Both images from *Electrical Experimenter,* January 1915.](images/eico_labs2.png)

Gernsback's own tinkering was conducted with his staff alongside their magazine publishing activities, beginning with the Electro Importing Company's main factory and office building at 233 Fulton Street, now on the site of Ground Zero.  Alongside Coggeshall, Harry Winfield Secor, and his brother Sidney Gernsback, Hugo manufactured not only traditional electrical equipment like telephone parts and headphones, but more speculative devices.^[@_e._1915]  The magazines often read like lab reports, detailing the progress made in these experiments in a way that opened them up to suggestions from the community.  The range and nature of the "inventions" detailed in the magazine is diverse.  The operative principle behind new devices like the Osophone were demonstrated through experiments that could be reproduced at home (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**).  **The Physiophone** introduced a means of transforming the music from a phonograph record into rhythmic pulses that could allow people with hearing impairments to enjoy music.  More farfetched devices like **The Isolator,** an oxygen-filled, soundproof helmet that aided concentration, were interspersed with the more serious proposals.

Experimentation continued when Gernsback founded WRNY, a medium-range broadcast station operating out of New York that was used to debut new broadcast media and analyze the effects of various instruments and signal processing techniques on the auditory perception of the station's listeners.  Several articles and editorials cover these experiments, including a live radio concert broadcast that included one of the earliest electronic keyboards in history.  **The Pianorad** looked like an automobile engine with a horn attached to the end, covered in radio tubes that looked like engine cylinders, with each tube controlling a single note on the keyboard.  The instrument was developed at the successor to E.I. Company, Radio News Laboratories.  WRNY is also notable for conducting one of the earliest regular television broadcasts on record, using a unique method of interleaving audio and visual signals across a single frequency (**Television and the Telephot**).^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, p. 238, quotes a *New York Times* announcement of WRNY beginning reluar television broadcasts.  During an otherwise regular radio broadcast, the image of the performer's face was sent out periodically throughout the program.]  While conducting these groundbreaking experiments, Gernsback kept developments at WRNY open to the contributions and participation of his readers.  In one editorial for *Radio News*, Gernsback describes the television as just a simple add-on or expansion kit to a normal domestic radio set:  "I am quite certain that the final television apparatus on your radio set will take up no more room than your present cone speaker."^[@gernsback_television_1927.]  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of Gernsback's magazines seemed---solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes---his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.[^2b9d]

[^2b9d]: WRNY was short-lived.  In 1927, under the guidance of then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the newly formed Federal Radio Commission included WRNY in its list of 164 smaller-scale stations who had to justify their existence or be forced to shut down.  Tim Wu:  “In effecting its program of clearing the airwaves, the agency relied on a new distinction between so-called general public service stations and propaganda stations.  These were, in effect, synonyms for ‘large’ and ‘small’ respectively, but it was apparently easier to assault the underdog if one could label him a propagandist, even though the term’s present pejorative sense would not take hold until used to describe communications in Nazi Germany.  In any case, by whatever name, the FRC favored the large, networked stations affiliated with NBC (and later CBS).  Because the large operators had superior equipment, and fuller and more varied schedules, the FRC could claim not implausibly that they better served the public.”  @wu_master_2010, p. 83.]

While Gernsback always opened up the work done in his labs and later at WRNY to the public, he often does so in describing a finished device that would be offered for sale in subsequent issues of the same magazine.  This often makes the mode of address confusing, as it is in **The Radioson Detector.**  What begins as an objective description of a new wireless component seems eventually to boil down to a product pitch.  Indeed, the Radioson would be advertised for sale from the Electro Importing Company in competitor's publications in the coming months.  But the level of detail Gernsback goes into here is unique, making this essay not just a product announcement, but a detailed discussion of how the device is constructed and the descisions that went into its design.  This is surprising, especially given that the intense commercial competition to improve on detector technology "meant that there often was a great deal of secrecy about technical details."^[@thackeray_when_1983.]  One wonders then who Gernsback is pitching this device to, and why.  If the Radioson is such a valuable advance in radio technology, why would he share the detailed blueprints for his design for the cost of a magazine issue?  

I think these pieces and others like them are best considered as a proof of concept for a growing group of "electrics" hobbyists.  The Telimco, for instance, was not exactly the revolutionary device that first brought radio to the masses Gernsback later liked to claim it was.  Though its advertisements claimed the set was "guaranteed to work up to one mile," the Telimco was notoriously finicky.^[@_wireless_1905]  As it was sold, the outfit had a range of merely 300-500 feet and could only receive signals from further distances when a large antenna was hooked up.  Further, it was highly susceptible to any kind of electrical interference, such as the elevator motor in the Electro Importing Company building, which caused difficulties during in-store demonstrations of the apparatus.  The Telimco's untuned circuits, which would produce a high degree of interference for any nearby radio station, would soon be outlawed by federal legislation.  For these reasons, its metal filings coherers "had all but disappeared from commercial work in 1910" according to historian of early radio Thomas White.^[@white_pioneering_1996]  From this perspective, the Telimco seems less a practical means of communication than the promise of its future iterations.  A similar tone can be found in profiles of other Gernsback inventions, like **The Physiophone:**  writings that begin with seemingly dry engineering specifications don't take long to spin out into wondrous possibilities, futures that seem to proceed organically from the most minuscule of details.

So while in essence, the Telimco was little more than a gimmick, a parlor trick---press a button and a bell in another room would ring without the need for any intervening wires---it was also a rough prototype, an aggregate of handmade compontents that encouraged and enabled a conversation on what the wireless medium may look like in the future.  The technical limitations of the device as it then stood didn't stop Gernsback from publishing instructions in 1908 on connecting a telephone mouthpiece to the transmitting end of the Telimco and an engine to the receiving end, so that the "power" of the human voice could be used to start that engine (**The Dynamophone**).  Or in the following year, describing how thousands of perfectly synchronized home wireless sets would be capable of sending a message to the aliens that surely must be listening for us on Mars (**Signaling to Mars**).  Or months later, laying out in great technical detail how it would be possible to send and receive motion pictures over the airwaves using currently available equipment (**Television and the Telephot**).  The Radison and the Telimco were two of countless artifacts profiled in the Gernsback magazines that blurred the lines between the real and the imaginary.  While some were awarded patents and others were available for sale, others seem more like branding exercises or rallying calls for a community of active amateur experimenters to run with the as-of-yet unrealizable idea.  More often than not, these above categories bleed into one another.  Above all, Gernsback thought that the best way for new ideas travel was to make them public, and allow others to "fork" or "version" his hardware so that the idea could grow faster.

Media theorists have been attempting to devise a conceptual language for an object that is collectively imagined before the conditions of its material possibility, from André Bazin's writings on the precinematic "myth of total cinema" ("The concept men had of it existed so to speak fully armed in their minds, as if in some Platonic heaven, and what strikes us most of all is the obstinate resistance of matter to ideas") to Friedrich Kittler's description of occult traditions and late-eighteenth-century magic lantern shows as a "relay race from illusionists to engineers."[^ap32]  Gernsback was able so successfully to outline the material possibility of an invention before it existed because he considered tinkering to be a matter of imagining the future.  While Thomas Edison would respond to Gernsback's question about the future of atomic energy in their interview (**Thomas Edison Speaks**), "You know, Mr. Gernsback, I am an inventor, and as such I do not concern myself overmuch with philosophical research," for Gernsback, invention was every bit a matter of this so-called "philosophy."

[^ap32]:  See @bazin_myth_2005, p. 17.  @kittler_optical_2010, p. 101.  @gunning_doing_2001.  @batchen_burning_1999.  In a similar vein, John Guillory writes that "this peculiar latency is characteristic of discourse about media from the sixteenth to the later nineteenth centuries. . . . The transposition of writing into print did not elicit at first a theoretical recognition of media as much as a reflection on the latency of print in the technology of writing itself. It was as though print were there, already, in the medium of writing. This is how Bacon understands print in the New Organon: 'the technique of printing certainly contains nothing which is not open and almost obvious.' Bacon explains that 'men went without this magnificent invention (which does so much for the spread of learning) for so many centuries' because they somehow failed to notice that letters and ink might be used for inscription with a different instrument than the pen, namely 'letter types' inked and pressed on paper, an ingenious form of endlessly reproducible writing.  @guillory_genesis_2010, 324.
