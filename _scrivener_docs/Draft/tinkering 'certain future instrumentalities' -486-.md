certain future instrumentalities”: Tinkering, Making, and Mineral Proficiencies

==================================================

Begin with the Osophone:  both a new invention, a try-it-at-home experiment with a sewing needle, and a speculative projection of Martian technology.  All of the threads are here together.  How tinkering with available materials allowed for new inventions, both actual and fantastic.  Describing the functioning of a particular technology as a means of aiding design practice, even when that design practice was a form of narrative speculation.

amateur inventor / corporate r & d

---------------------------------------------

What is a "maker" or a "tinkerer" around 1910?  Mucker, experimenter.  Above all, a form of intuition or creativity, of excellence in being able to make something magical.

Get our terms straight:  HG used "tinkerer," a term that was associated with Romani gypsies, who would fix old things.  Edison suggested "mucker."  Today, we might say "maker."  But the point is, that the incremental modification associated with a term like "tinkering" involves just as much creative expression, expertise, and skill as the whole cloth production of a new technology we might associate with "invention."

1916 May -- "Edison Says You are a 'Mucker'!"  15 (anon) -- term of endearment for all scientific experimenters.  "Are you an electrical Experimenter?  Yes?  Well, in that case you are a 'MUCKER'!  A plain, common, ordinary, everyday mucker!!  So says one Thomas Alva Edison, and if the 'Wiz' says so it must be true.  You say you don't like to be called such names?  It's a distinction to be called a mucker.  Edison says he is a mucker himself.  Says all scientific experimenters are muckers.  So there!" @experimentation

@aitken_continuous_1985 avoids "the standard and readily available definitions of technology, which normally emphasize either hardware or methods.  Behind these definitions there lies an older and less limiting idea: the conception of technology as knowledge -- Aristotle's 'reasoned state of capacity to make.'"

machine shop / individual invention

==============================

Takes place between the machine shop model of innovation w/ the telegraph, according to Paul Israel (an age that some mythologize as the era of the independent inventor) and its transition, thanks largely to Edison, to corporate R&D (which many also mythologize as being solely the province of scientists disconnected from practical innovation, when in fact there was a great deal of small-scale tinkering, and, according to Hintz, independent inventors lived on).

A literature (Israel, Hintz) that troubles this transition between lone, independent inventors to collective, massively funded corporate research labs … and the HG articles take place in this moment, making it too easy to say that their readership was part of a dying breed, or that the transition to scientifiction magazines in the late 1920s was a product of this readership feeling left out of the community of invention, as we will discuss later.

"the rise of modern corporate-based industrial research laboratories in the twentieth century" @israel_machine_1992, 2

a parallel between this twentieth century transition and another moment in the nineteenth century with the rise of machine shops:  "In the place of many lone, independent inventors we begin to see a pattern of cooperative shop invention in which skilled operatives, superintendents, machinists, and manufacturers make up technological communities that draw on practical experience to design, build, and refine new technology." @israel_machine_1992, 2  Communicating through trade journals like *The Telegrapher* in the 1860s.

In this shop culture, "few inventors [working on the telegraph] actually worked alone and none worked in complete isolation.  Conceptualization was often stimulated by access to new information.  And the construction, testing, and redesigning of apparatus necessary for practical application almost invariably required an inventor to seek the assistance of others, whose own contributions often altered the original design.  The power of the popular heroic model of invention, which treats initial conceptualization as the true inventive act, has caused the more methodical activities involved in the development of a practical invention to often be treated as ancillary, thus obscuring the diversity of other contributions oftne necessary to the successful inventive enterprise." @israel_machine_1992, 57

As Hugh Aitken puts it, the most meaningful development in the emergence of radio -- the transition from spark gap sets to continuous wave transmission -- wasn't primarily a question of how science and technology defined themselves in relation to one another.  Rather, this transition happened "at the hazy boundary where radio stopped being a matter for visionary experimenters and started to become a hardheaded business capable of gaining and holding a commercial market."^[@aitken_continuous_1985, p. 9-10.]

(from 192302: [^keq]: Though Gernsback is obviously trying to stir up his readership, this article touches on a very real anxiety about the role of the amateur in a world of increasingly professionalized engineering and invention. But historian of technology Eric S. Hintz argues that despite commonly accepted wisdom, independent inventors continued to be a source of viable innovations well into the twentieth century, when corporate research and development was gradually beginning to take on greater importance. Well after the "heroic" era of inventors like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell:)

I have seen many different editions of these magazines in various archives, academic and private, and seen many scans available in various places online.  Many of the issues have scribbles in the margins, newspaper articles and other ephemera attached between the pages.  An active readership, working out technical issues, solving problems, thinking actively.

Don't even have to use the technologies, if you can't afford them.  Reading a form of experimentation:  1923 Feb -- Letter.  1434.  Stephens, Richard J.  "You can better realize what these magazines mean to me when I say that I seldom, if ever, get a chance to have the material to experiment with, so I must content myself with reading matter, and I do like to read, especially such a wealth of material as is combined in the pages of your three publications."  That the readers can think of themselves as experimenters while reading… "as long as Gernsback addressed his readers in semi-technical terms." (Drown 91)

Mineral proficiencies, rolling expertise

--------------------------------------------------

Gernsback devoted space in many of his editorials to thinking about the process by which "new things" come into the world, and the special forms of creativity that emerge when an inventor draws equally upon science and the arts to design a technology.  In many ways, he was far ahead of his time in proposing several frameworks for understanding invention, even if they were underdeveloped.  It wouldn't be for many years that the social and historical study of technology would be accepted as a serious academic pursuit, as Hugh Aitken writes in the 1976 prologue to his magisterial, two-volume history of radio:

> If the 'new things' of science, technology, and economic life often seem overwhelming and uncontrollable, the reason may well be that we have, in modern societies, created highly efficient structures for the generation of new knowledge without seriously attending to the processes by which new knowledge is put to use. . . . historians of the future will find it strange that so few social scientists of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.[^nwpn]

[^nwpn]: @aitken_syntony_1976, 9.  Aitken is citing here @merton_priorities_1957.

This is of course no longer the case, with the vibrant field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) beginning to have a great influence on a diverse number of disciplines.  But it's important to note here that the questions raised by Gernsback in a pulp publishing context wouldn't have sufficient answers even among academic historians and sociologists of technology for many decades to come.

Gernsback's views on these issues evolved over the years thanks in part to the debates, suggestions, and questions he and his staff printed in lively correspondence sections like The Oracle and Patent Advice.  Questions from readers ranged from the factual (how many feet come in a pound of No. 12 B.&S. triple-braided weather proof wire?) to the experimental (might two lead plates submerged in sulphuric acid make a good storage battery?).  It was important for knowledge to be freely shared among readers, contributors, and editors, since the construction of wireless sets involved many different forms of expertise.  "A radio set builder," wrote Gernsback in a 1925 editorial, "must be a carpenter, an electrician, a metal worker, a tinsmith, and a radio engineer, all rolled into one."^[@gernsback_radio_1925.]  [[AT CERTAIN POINTS INTEGRATES THE SKILLS OF MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE INTO ONE MYTHICAL FIGURE, A LONE INVENTOR.  AND YET OFFERS UP HIS DEVICES TO A COMMUNITY OF TINKERERS, WHICH MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE WAY PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT SKILL SETS COLLABORATE ON INVENTING NEW THINGS.  CAN I MAKE A CHRONOLOGICAL NARRATIVE OF HIS VIEWS DEVELOPING IN THIS MANNER?  OR JUST POINT OUT THE CONTRADICTION AS SUCH?]]  Initially, Gernsback argued that such impressively skilled inventors were born, not made.  While many could learn to be "mechanical" inventors, or those "who are suddenly confronted with a certain device that to their minds seems imperfect, whereupon they will bend their energies towards improving the existing device," true inventors were hard to come by (**The Born and the Mechanical Inventor**).  In cultural studies of media and technology today, we might think of these two styles of invention as Gernsback formulates them -- the whole cloth innovation of shiny new tools versus incremental acts of modification and repair -- as reflections of a hemispheric divide.  Steven J. Jackson argues that "a Western and productivist imagination" biases much of media studies today, obscuring the vast majority of technological practices in the developing world:  "breakdown, maintenance, and repair constitute crucial but vastly understudied sites or moments within the worlds of new media and technology today."^[For more on "the distinctive repair ecologies of the developing world," see @jackson_rethinking_2014.]

Eventually, Gernsback began to shift his views on invention so that they were more in line with the educational goals of his magazines.  In **Why The Radio Set Builder,** we begin to understand that the biggest contributions to this community of makers were not necessarily made by its most broadly educated members.  To the contrary, the most important things that an experimenter needed to know would emerge organically from the process of tinkering, in a dialogue between a person and an inanimate object.  Gernsback advocated making things by hand not just as a hobby, a means of diversion or release after the working day is over (he seems in the below editorial to be addressing the white collar worker in particular), but as a complete education in tools, materials, and techniques:

> If, for instance, you are making an elaborate radio console for your living room, you will get more information on the subject than you could possibly get from the best text-books.  You will, first of all, become familiar with the various tools necessary to fashion the wood, and if you own a woodworking lathe you will learn quite a good deal about the operation of wood-turning and the tools to be used for this particular purpose.  You will learn what it means to sandpaper, you will learn to recognize the different kinds of wood, and you will know the difference between green and kiln-dried variety of woods.  You will soon know how to use glue, and what kind.  You will study the various fillers, and, last but not least, you will get a thorough education in varnishes and paints, and the use of all of these.^[@gernsback_handicraft_1927]

For Gernsback, the know-how that emerges from making things is cascading: hands gradually feeling their way along an interlocking series of dependent skills and material properties.  As we see in **The Perversity of Things,** objects only ever seem like frustrating "obstacles" in the way of a good idea when we don't fully understand the proper affordances of those objects.  "It is not the things that are perverse, it is ourselves who make them seem perverse."  With enough experience, barriers and constraints begin to look like creative opportunities.  Gernsback refers to this capacity to see finished form in raw materials as a "knack" or an "intuition."  It's what allows one reader to build an audion tube from scratch, that ultimate symbol of inscrutable corporate complexity, by learning glassblowing.^[@reed_unterrified_1916.]  Or another to make the first ever permanent recording of a radio broadcast by modifying his phonograph player so that it could register the signals from his wireless set.^[@apgar_amateur_1915.]  The more experience an experimenter had with a wide variety of materials and techniques, the better attuned his intuition would become when it came to making new devices.

Today, the intense material specificity of the technologies as they were described to the readers of these magazines is highly impressive.  In Gernsback's writings, one is struck not only by the romance of communicating in private through secret codes and the intimacy of a headset, but also by the exotic materials that made this experience possible.  Pieces like **The Dynamophone** and **A Treatise on Wireless Telegraphy** address a readership with an already impressive material awareness of their apparatus, and introduce new possibilities each month to the wireless medium's construction and operation.  Thanks to these mineral proficiencies, a rural midwestern reader would know that news from New York may become audible if only he could find some molybdenite, or a supplier willing to ship him the nitric acid needed to try out a new electrolytic detector.^[For more on molybdenite and how amateurs used it, see **A Treatise on Wireless**.]  The sheer alchemy that went into the construction of these apparatuses -- glass light bulbs filled with argon gas, impure silicon crudely fused into thin wafers, influential experiments conducted by an employee of AT&T with the contents of a "Minerals of Maine" souvenir box -- makes the effects they were able to achieve seem all the more wonderful.^[The "Minerals of Maine" box included iron pyrite, galena, chalcopyrite, and magnetite.  See @douglas_crystal_1981; @thackeray_when_1983.]

Details such as these seem especially poignant in light of recent calls for a critical awareness of the rare earth minerals used in the production of today's increasingly complex digital devices, as well as the environmental toll of the electronic waste these devices leave behind once we inevitably acquiesce to their fragility by replacing them with the latest release.  In an article on the dust produced during the manufacture and disposal of hardware, Jussi Parikka writes of a "persistence that lingers across scales from minerals and chemical elements to the lungs and organic tissue."^[@parikka_dust_2013.]  Timothy Morton refers to these persistent objects, often produced and disposed of under appalling working conditions in China and countries across Africa, as "hyperobjects":  manufactured materials or devices that "do not rot in our lifetimes.  They do not burn without . . . releasing radiation, dioxins, and so on."^[@morton_ecological_2012, p. 130.]  That gadgets like smartphones and tablets today are described as "magical" or like "touching the future" should come as no surprise.  Not only are they black boxes that become increasingly difficult to modify, repair, or tinker with every year, they are blissfully disconnected from the labor practices and material conditions that go into producing them.  We encounter a very different kind of moment through Gernsback's writings.  Of course the emerging technology of wireless was pure magic:  it allowed people to skim disembodied voices from the air.  But wireless was magical to Gernsback's readers not because they didn't understand how the trick worked, but because they did.  That elemental, raw materials could produce such effects was absolutely fantastic, and provided an endless source of fascination.

Gernsback's own tinkering was conducted with his staff alongside their magazine publishing activities, beginning with the Electro Importing Company's main factory and office building at 233 Fulton Street, now on the site of Ground Zero.  Alongside Coggeshall, H.W. Secor, and his brother Sidney Gernsback, Hugo manufactured not only traditional electrical equipment like telephone parts and headphones, but more speculative devices.^[@_e._1915]  The magazines served as lab reports, detailing the progress made in these experiments in a way that opened them up to suggestions from the community.  The range and nature of the "inventions" detailed in the magazine is diverse.  The operative principle behind new devices like the Osophone were demonstrated through experiments that could be reproduced at home (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**).  **The Physiophone** introduced a means of transforming the music from a phonograph record into rhythmic pulses that could allow people with hearing impairments to enjoy music.  More farfetched devices like **The Isolator,** a chamber worn over the head that aided concentration, were interspersed with the more serious proposals.

Experimentation continued when Gernsback founded WRNY, a broadcast station… that was used to test out even more devices.

@moskowitz_explorers_1963, p. 238, quotes a NY Times announcement of a WRNY regular TV broadcast.  The face of a performer sent out after a normal audio radio broadcast.

Gernsback oversaw experiments with broadcast media and the effects of various instruments and signal processing techniques on the auditory perception of the station's listeners from his radio station WRNY.  Several articles and editorials cover these experiments, including a concert broadcasting some of some of the earliest electronic instruments developed at the E.I. Company offices (**The Pianorad**) as well as one of the earliest television broadcasts on record, using a unique method of interleaving audio and visual signals across a single frequency (**Television and the Telephot**).

**The Pianorad,** stands as one of the earliest electric keyboards in history.  It looks like an automobile engine with a horn attached to the end of it, covered in radio tubes that looked like engine cylinders, each tube controlling a single note on the keyboard.

While conducting these groundbreaking experiments, Gernsback kept these developments open to the contributions and participation of his readers.  In one editorial for *Radio News*, ("Television to the Front") Gernsback describes the television as just a simple add-on or expansion kit to a normal domestic radio set.  "I am quite certain that the final television apparatus on your radio set will take up no more room than your present cone speaker."  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of Gernsback's magazines seemed—solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes—his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appear as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one can pick and choose from out of the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog*.

While Gernsback always made the work done in his labs and at WRNY "open" to the public, he is often describing finished devices that would be offered for sale in subsequent issues of the same magazine.  This often makes the mode of address confusing, as it is in **The Radioson Detector.**  What begins as an objective description of a new wireless component seems eventually to boil down to a product pitch.  Indeed, the Radioson would be advertised for sale from the Electro Importing Company in competitor's publications in the coming months.  But the level of detail Gernsback goes into here is unique, making this essay not just a product announcement, but a detailed discussion of how the device is constructed and why.  Which is surprising given that the intense commercial competition to make the next best detector "meant that there often was a great deal of secrecy about technical details."^[@thackeray_when_1983]

One wonders then who Gernsback is pitching this device to, and why.  If this is such a valuable advance in radio technology, and if Gernsback was truly the obsessive profit-seeker that SF historians like to claim he is, why would he share blueprints for his design?  Why make this public and allow any experimenter to reproduce the results he's achieved?  Did he already try to pitch this to companies and they turned it down because, obviously, a Radioson detector can't be more powerful than the Audion?  Perhaps it is the best possible version:  that Gernsback was on to something, and he thought the best way for ideas travel is to share them, make them public, allow others to "fork" or "version" his hardware so that the idea grows faster that way.  Was this a possible model of collective tinkering before corporatized R&D and professional engineering?
