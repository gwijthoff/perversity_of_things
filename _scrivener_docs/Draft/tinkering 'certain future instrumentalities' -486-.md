[tinkering]

overarching story

------------------

The Electro Importing company's "main factory and office building at 233 Fulton Street," which is now the site of Ground Zero and the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.  Gernsback's private laboratory was on the fifth floor, "and the room abounds with bottles of all sizes, graduates, hydrometers, voltmeters and ammeters, crucibles, et cetera."  Working together in the main laboratory are Sidney Gernsback and H.W. Secor.  "…the Company makes practically all its own radio instruments, including telephone and wireless head 'phones."  @_e._1915.

Immediately after launching *Modern Electrics,* Gernsback writes to luminaries in the field, requesting articles and interviews.  To Edison, 3.28.09: "The writer believes you to be interested in the propagation of the electrical arts among the Young and as MODERN ELECTRICS is devoted exclusively to young people the writer hopes that his step will find approval by the Master of Electricity."

Takes place between the machine shop model of innovation w/ the telegraph, according to Paul Israel (an age that some mythologize as the era of the independent inventor) and its transition, thanks largely to Edison, to corporate R&D (which many also mythologize as being solely the province of scientists disconnected from practical innovation, when in fact there was a great deal of small-scale tinkering, and, according to Hintz, independent inventors lived on).

(from 192302: [^keq]: Though Gernsback is obviously trying to stir up his readership, this article touches on a very real anxiety about the role of the amateur in a world of increasingly professionalized engineering and invention. But historian of technology Eric S. Hintz argues that despite commonly accepted wisdom, independent inventors continued to be a source of viable innovations well into the twentieth century, when corporate research and development was gradually beginning to take on greater importance. Well after the "heroic" era of inventors like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell:)

"The amateur's work is valuable."  from Grundy's letter on who will save the radio amateur 192302 -- not just blind tinkering, but "work."

What begins as an objective description of a new wireless component seems to eventually boil down to a product pitch.  Indeed, the Radioson would be advertised for sale from the Electro Importing Company in competitor's publications in the coming months.  But the level of detail Gernsback goes into here is unique, making this essay not just a product announcement, but a detailed discussion of how the device is constructed and why:

> Detectors and detector theory did not develop in smooth and rational progression, but in the usual fascinatingly wayward manner associated with most human activities. Only on rare occasions did researchers describe their technology with clarity. Moreover, commercial competition meant that there often was a great deal of secrecy about technical details. @thackeray_when_1983

One wonders then who Gernsback is pitching this device to, and why.  If this is such a valuable advance in radio technology, and if Gernsback was truly the obsessive profit-seeker that SF historians like to claim he is, why would he share blueprints for his design?  Why make this public and allow any experimenter to reproduce the results he's achieved?  Did he already try to pitch this to companies and they turned it down because, obviously, a Radioson detector can't be more powerful than the Audion?  Perhaps it is the best possible version:  that Gernsback was on to something, and he thought the best way for ideas travel is to share them, make them public, allow others to "fork" or "version" his hardware so that the idea grows faster that way.  Was this a possible model of collective tinkering before corporatized R&D and professional engineering?

interested in the material possibility of inventions before they are an idea.  See 191608_perversity and… (fn text: media theorists have attempted to come up with a language for the idea of something before it's material possibility, citing Bazin)

how does one develop the inventor's intuition?  by learning about materials and process.  each technique involves the learning of countless other techniques. "Handicraft," quoted in fn for 192702_why_set_builder.

links from Henry on popular scientific education here.  While Gernsback talks about sci edu more in the scientifiction section than tinkering, this is a good place to bring up these themes in the intro, esp. if i'm not directly tying each intro section to organizational "themes" of the book.  So, what role does the tinkerer have between 19thC and institutionalized science?  And, contextualize push for public science education in the US

see prologue to Aitken, Syntony and Spark on invention as a kind of guessing, separate from science, a blind creativity.

From a footnote to possibly move:  [^fns]: In an editorial for *Science and Invention* titled "Handicraft" and published in the same month as this piece, Gernsback advocates for the importance of making things as a hobby for the white collar worker.  Tinkering isn't just a means of diversion or release after the working day is over, it serves as an education in tools, materials, and techniques.  For Gernsback, the know-how that emerges from the experience of making things is cascading: hands gradually feeling their way along an interlocking series of dependent skills and material properties.  (From 192702 Why the Radio Set Builder, an important piece)

## Tinkering and technology

> *Reports on broadcast experiments at Gernsback's WRNY radio station, new inventions developed at the Electro Importing Company labs, and critical essays on techniques for thinking creatively through technology.*

Gernsback oversaw experiments with broadcast media and the effects of various instruments and signal processing techniques on the auditory perception of the station's listeners from his radio station WRNY.  Several articles and editorials cover these experiments, including a concert broadcasting some of some of the earliest electronic instruments developed at the E.I. Company offices ("The Pianorad") as well as one of the earliest television broadcasts on record, using a unique method of interleaving audio and visual signals across a single frequency ("Television and the Telephot").  Gernsback championed the creativity and problem-solving abilities of the tinkerer throughout his career ("Why the Radio Set Builder"; "Is Radio at a Standstill?")

While conducting these groundbreaking experiments, Gernsback kept these developments open to the contributions and participation of his readers.  In one editorial for *Radio News*, ("Television to the Front") Gernsback describes the television as just a simple add-on or expansion kit to a normal domestic radio set.  "I am quite certain that the final television apparatus on your radio set will take up no more room than your present cone speaker."  Regardless of how advanced the devices detailed in the pages of Gernsback's magazines seemed—solar cells, automobile mounted radiotelephones, electric keyboards powered by vacuum tubes—his staff reported on them as if they only required a combination of already existing electrical principles and components.  These new media appear as little more than the sum of individual building blocks that one can pick and choose from out of the pages of the *Electro Importing Catalog*.

Edison on atomic technology:  "You know, Mr. Gernsback, I am an inventor, and as such I do not concern myself overmuch with philosophical research."  What Gernsback does as "philosophy" about future possibilities.
