Fashion concerns for wearables, in this case for a hearing aid to the partially deaf:  "Ladies will find it a neat instrument easily worn, so as not to be noticed.  The transmitter and battery can be placed under a light shirt waist on the breast, and the receiver and head-band is readily covered over with the hair; so that practically none of the device is visible."  @secor_electro_1914

Women are also tied to disability in the profile of an unfortunately unnamed inventor of a device that makes the telephone more accessible:

> Knowing nothing of the workings of electricity or the telephone, but living daily with a paralyzed husband and mother, who in her absence could not lift the receiver to answer the 'phone, a Memphis, Tenn. woman has invented and patented an appliance to the telephone which enables one to talk and hear without using the hands at all.^[@_woman_1915.]

![From *Electrical Experimenter,* December 1915.](images/women_inventor.png)

As people who possess some technical knowledge of a very different kind, and still need to be educated about electricity:

> The average housewife has an insight as to the workings of her sewing machine and a general layman's knowledge about coal gas; then why not know a few simple imperative things concerning electricity? … As it is probable that the reader of this magazine is of the mere male sex, the writer humbly suggests that his audience make an earnest attempt to enlighten his mother, sister or wife (or intended spouse) with a few simple, common facts about the general uses and application of the electric current common to the household.^[@shaw_what_1915]

Or the self taught, as was Margaret Lavina Campbell of Rockport, Massachusetts.  She writes in a letter:

> It seems strange that so few young women are interested in wireless telegraphy.  However, I had a special reason for my interest in the science aside from the fascination which has attracted me to it.

> Some might suppose that my interest was aroused through having a brother of someone in the home interested in the subject, but such is not the case.

> My reason for taking up wireless was due to my desire to install an outfit on my father's yacht.  Consequently I purchased the apparatus here and began studying in order to pass the examinations for a license.  All operators on ships are of course required to have a license.  I took my examination, July 9, 1915, at the Navy Yard, Boston, and received my certificate the following day.  I did not attend any school of telegraphy. … I receive WCC, NAA and boats at sea, I hear Uncle Sam's warships when they are practising their war games and maneuvers off the coast here.^[@campbell_miss_1916]

Cover story without author listed, "The Feminine Wireless Amateur."

> Just because a man, Signor Guglielmo Marconi by name, invented commercial wireless telegraphy does not mean for a moment that the fair sex cannot master its mysteries.  To prove that the girls and women of the country are rapidly awakening to the fact that radio operating is a worth-while accomplishment, both vocationally and intellectually, we have the pleasure of presenting herewith a number of photographs showing the Radio activities of our fairer sex.

Parkin finds wireless telegraphy to be "a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed."  Also profiled is Graynella Packer, "the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity," the Clyde liner *Mohawk.*  The Navy made a nationwide call for "wireless operators who would be available in time of war," and many who signed up and were trained in "preparedness camps" were women.  Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve.

Also, profile of Maria Dolores Estrada, a refugee from the war of Mexican independence who, "at the age when many Americans are just leaving home for high school, Mara Dolores Estrada was watching men kill each other in fierce battle.  She has known what it is to languish starving and without water in one of those horrible Mexican prisons, and she has hidden, terror-stricken while the terrible Villa and his more terrible bandit followers have searched from house to house to find her.  For two years before she came to Burlington she served on the official staff of General Venustiano Carranza, first … the de facto government of Mexico and leader of the rebellion against Huerta (?)

Was employed as the private telegrapher to General Carranza.  When she came to the US, taught herself English as well as wireless signaling, and was given a first-grade commercial wireless license by the US Department of Commerce.  "And because there was more time that could be spent to advantage in this wonderful country of opportunity, maria also learned stenography."^[@_mexican_1917]

Radio News 192003, anonymity again important.  The anonymity of amateur Morse code operators, and the anonymity of pulp fiction writers with assumed names

	1920 Mar -- "The Autobiography of a Girl Amateur."  Anon. author. p 490.  Fell of "on the internet no one knows you're a dog…"  A personal review of early radio.  From website:  "Although most amateur enthusiasts were male, in 1911 a young woman, who worked as a landline telegrapher but hoped to someday become a shipboard radio operator, joined the New York City-area airwaves." … The great majority of early amateur radio enthusiasts were male. And some of the females on the airwaves felt compelled to hide their identities, as was the case with this account of an anonymous amateur from the New York City area. Until the mid-1920s, most amateurs used Morse Code, so you couldn't be identified by your voice. Also, from the beginning of government licencing of amateurs in late 1912 until 1933, it was the radio transmitters which were assigned callsigns, and everyone who transmitted from an individual station used that transmitter callsign. So there was no way to determine which persons were "at the key" if they didn't choose to identify themselves. Moreover, a station's callsign entry in the callbooks listed only the name of the person who had submitted the paperwork for the station licence, which in this case was the author's brother. Station operators had to hold valid operator licences, but these didn't have callsigns assigned to them. However, most amateur stations at this time had only one operator, so in most cases when you heard a station callsign, you could be reasonably sure that the person listed in the station callbook was the operator."  http://earlyradiohistory.us/1920auto.htm
