In fact, it's impressive the degree to which race and gender are absolutely invisible in almost all of Gernsback's writings, a kind of "white washing" that perhaps would only be possible for a male Jewish immigrant.

Though Gernsback seldom addressed women, his writers sometimes reported on women in wireless, with some very interesting examples.  Mexican war refugee, women's suffragists.

When not simply listening in, operating wireless telegraph sets afforded a degree of anonymity to women who otherwise would have been excluded from these conversations and various forms of activities (DXing, mischief, etc.).

Though it is indeed rare that women are made visible in the pages of these magazines except as occasional curiosities, a later editorial by Gernsback makes clear that they played a vital role at virtually every level of the magazine's production.  A 1928 issue of *Science of Invention* opens with a fanciful tale in which King Outis VII of Erehwon, a great fan of the magazine, visits the offices of Experimenter Publishing to witness how the magazine is made.  He meets with editors, artists, advertising staff, linotypers, compositors, proof-readers, the binding department, and photographers.  Following the supply chain even deeper, Gernsback introduces the King to the "chemical houses who furnished the chemicals for making the pulp and bleaching it," the coal mines that made possible the steam to make that sulphite pulp paper, even the hens that laid the eggs "used in the photo-engraving process to supply albumen."  When the King finally asks "who all the pretty girls were that had clustered together in one aggregation," 

> We informed him immediately that they were secretaries, stenographers and typists, as well as editors and proofreaders and many others who had directly to do with the production of the magazine.  The firm that did the composing had several dozen girls that performed various jobs in connection with the magazine.  The printer had a number of girls who were either bookkeepers or stenographers, through whose hands passed the bills for the magazine, and the same was true of practically every other industry connected with the production of the magazine.^[@gernsback_magazine_1928.]

Though women are rarely made visible in the content of these magazines themselves, they are there at every stage in the process of their production, from the graphite mines to the chemical supply houses to the newsdealers.  Women are the very circuits that connect and regulate all of the magazine's material inputs and outputs.  

Replicated on Mars, with Martian women part of a "Tos rod" correspondence technology in *Baron Münchausen.*  For some reason, direct thought transference needs a secretary to make a record of it.  A "sensitive recording mechanism" that is "in charge of a secretary" -- one would think he means in *the* charge of a secretary, but who knows.  the role of the female secretary in this procedure is strange.  the entire process is described as the product of a machine, a stylus.  nowhere does she come into the operation, unless she’s occluded by the passive voice…  “is always recorded,” “is carefully labeled and stored away.”^[@CITE_SPECIFIC_INSTALMENT]

Fashion concerns for wearables, in this case for a hearing aid to the partially deaf:  "Ladies will find it a neat instrument easily worn, so as not to be noticed.  The transmitter and battery can be placed under a light shirt waist on the breast, and the receiver and head-band is readily covered over with the hair; so that practically none of the device is visible."  @secor_electro_1914

Women are also tied to disability in the profile of an unfortunately unnamed inventor of a device that makes the telephone more accessible:

> Knowing nothing of the workings of electricity or the telephone, but living daily with a paralyzed husband and mother, who in her absence could not lift the receiver to answer the 'phone, a Memphis, Tenn. woman has invented and patented an appliance to the telephone which enables one to talk and hear without using the hands at all.^[@_woman_1915.]

![From *Electrical Experimenter,* December 1915.](images/women_inventor.png)

As people who possess some technical knowledge of a very different kind, and still need to be educated about electricity:

> The average housewife has an insight as to the workings of her sewing machine and a general layman's knowledge about coal gas; then why not know a few simple imperative things concerning electricity? … As it is probable that the reader of this magazine is of the mere male sex, the writer humbly suggests that his audience make an earnest attempt to enlighten his mother, sister or wife (or intended spouse) with a few simple, common facts about the general uses and application of the electric current common to the household.^[@shaw_what_1915]

Or the self taught, as was Margaret Lavina Campbell of Rockport, Massachusetts.  She writes in a letter:

> It seems strange that so few young women are interested in wireless telegraphy.  However, I had a special reason for my interest in the science aside from the fascination which has attracted me to it.

> Some might suppose that my interest was aroused through having a brother of someone in the home interested in the subject, but such is not the case.

> My reason for taking up wireless was due to my desire to install an outfit on my father's yacht.  Consequently I purchased the apparatus here and began studying in order to pass the examinations for a license.  All operators on ships are of course required to have a license.  I took my examination, July 9, 1915, at the Navy Yard, Boston, and received my certificate the following day.  I did not attend any school of telegraphy. … I receive WCC, NAA and boats at sea, I hear Uncle Sam's warships when they are practising their war games and maneuvers off the coast here.^[@campbell_miss_1916]

Cover story without author listed, "The Feminine Wireless Amateur."

> Just because a man, Signor Guglielmo Marconi by name, invented commercial wireless telegraphy does not mean for a moment that the fair sex cannot master its mysteries.  To prove that the girls and women of the country are rapidly awakening to the fact that radio operating is a worth-while accomplishment, both vocationally and intellectually, we have the pleasure of presenting herewith a number of photographs showing the Radio activities of our fairer sex.

Parkin finds wireless telegraphy to be "a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed."  Also profiled is Graynella Packer, "the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity," the Clyde liner *Mohawk.*  The Navy made a nationwide call for "wireless operators who would be available in time of war," and many who signed up and were trained in "preparedness camps" were women.  Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve.

Taking over her son's set to broadcast suffragist messages.  "Mrs. Alexander MacKenzie, of the New York Women's Suffrage party, Yonkers".

> Mrs. MacKenzie's son had rigged up a wireless outfit on the roof of her Yonkers home and she learned to send messages and to receive them to a limited extent. During the summer of 1915 she went to the instruments every day at stated hours, morning, noon and night, and flashed out the words---*Votes for women*---400 miles into space.  Usually she got replies, sometimes from land wireless stations and sometimes from ships at sea, ranging from "Good for you old lady!" and "We're with you!" to "Oh, piffle!" Then again she assumed to be the Goddess of Liberty, and made quite a wireless "speech" explaining how she had grown old waiting for woman suffrage.

According to Mrs. MacKenzie, the Yonkers organization used wireless in their 24-hour election night demonstration in November 1915, making speeches in Manor House Square and receiving messages in between "from various celebrities and other suffragists."

> Again, this is not the end and all of the proposition at all.  We have before us the great and as yet, but little explored field of *radio engineering.*  Women seem to progress excellently in the engineering branches.  Primarily this is so because her brain is quick of action, and moreover she usually will be found to have extremely well-balanced ideas as to proportions, so essential in designing. A wonderful imagination coupled to a number of other worthy faculties help to make a really fine combination, so that we find a steadily growing number of women architects, mechanical and electrical experts, radio operators, civil engineers, *ad lib.*  What we need is more of them in the higher positions, where the square root and binomial theorem are everyday quantities.^[@_feminine_1916.]

Also, profile of Maria Dolores Estrada, a refugee from the war of Mexican independence who, "at the age when many Americans are just leaving home for high school, Mara Dolores Estrada was watching men kill each other in fierce battle.  She has known what it is to languish starving and without water in one of those horrible Mexican prisons, and she has hidden, terror-stricken while the terrible Villa and his more terrible bandit followers have searched from house to house to find her.  For two years before she came to Burlington she served on the official staff of General Venustiano Carranza, first … the de facto government of Mexico and leader of the rebellion against Huerta (?)

Was employed as the private telegrapher to General Carranza.  When she came to the US, taught herself English as well as wireless signaling, and was given a first-grade commercial wireless license by the US Department of Commerce.  "And because there was more time that could be spent to advantage in this wonderful country of opportunity, maria also learned stenography."^[@_mexican_1917]

Radio News 192003, anonymity again important.  The anonymity of amateur Morse code operators, and the anonymity of pulp fiction writers with assumed names

	1920 Mar -- "The Autobiography of a Girl Amateur."  Anon. author. p 490.  Fell of "on the internet no one knows you're a dog…"  A personal review of early radio.  From website:  "Although most amateur enthusiasts were male, in 1911 a young woman, who worked as a landline telegrapher but hoped to someday become a shipboard radio operator, joined the New York City-area airwaves." … The great majority of early amateur radio enthusiasts were male. And some of the females on the airwaves felt compelled to hide their identities, as was the case with this account of an anonymous amateur from the New York City area. Until the mid-1920s, most amateurs used Morse Code, so you couldn't be identified by your voice. Also, from the beginning of government licencing of amateurs in late 1912 until 1933, it was the radio transmitters which were assigned callsigns, and everyone who transmitted from an individual station used that transmitter callsign. So there was no way to determine which persons were "at the key" if they didn't choose to identify themselves. Moreover, a station's callsign entry in the callbooks listed only the name of the person who had submitted the paperwork for the station licence, which in this case was the author's brother. Station operators had to hold valid operator licences, but these didn't have callsigns assigned to them. However, most amateur stations at this time had only one operator, so in most cases when you heard a station callsign, you could be reasonably sure that the person listed in the station callbook was the operator."  http://earlyradiohistory.us/1920auto.htm
