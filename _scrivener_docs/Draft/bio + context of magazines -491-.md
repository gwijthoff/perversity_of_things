"up-to-date technic":  Hugo Gernsback and Media Theory in the Making

========================================================

Born Hugo Gernsbacher in 1884, the third son of Jewish German émigrés to Luxembourg, Gernsback was raised in Hollerich, a tiny suburb of the nation's capital.  His parents, Moritz and Bertha Gernsbacher (née Dürlacher), raised him in comfortable circumstances thanks to Moritz's successful wine wholesaling business.  Growing up off the grid (Hollerich wasn't yet connected to Luxembourg City's new electricity network), the young Gernsback's passion for technology began with the battery after a handyman employed by his father, Jean-Pierre Görgen, taught him at six years old how to wire a series of bells to a Leclanché cell.  Gernsback recalls being instantly enchanted by the bell "ringing amid a shower of wonderful green sparks," and would soon acquire a reputation for wiring homes and businesses in the area with telephones and these ringers.^[@oneil_amazing_1963. @gernsback_old_1938.]  According to a story he often told later in life, Gernsback received special permission from Pope Leo XIII at thirteen years old to enter the Carmelite convent of Luxembourg City to install a series of electric call bells for the nuns there.^[@siegel_hugo_1988, 16.]

Though this story is partially verifiable through a certificate of thanks from the Convent found by the Luxembourgeois Centre National de Littérature, it's worth pointing out here that the portrait of Gernsback's life we are left with in the historical record consists largely of a series of self-propagated stories that border on braggadocio:  that a police officer intruded on the Electro Importing Company offices to interrogate them for fraud with the Telimco set in 1906, for "no wireless combination could be sold at this low price"^[Reportedly, the officer shot back after the demonstration: "I still think youse guys is a bunch of fakers. This ad here says that you are selling a *wireless* machine. Well, if you do, what are all them wires for?" @gernsback_old_1938.]; that Gernsback coined the term "television" in his December 1909 editorial **Television and the Telephot** (he didn't); that his recommendations were incorporated "word for word" into the Radio Act of 1912 (while the recommendation was, the wording wasn't---see **The Alexander Wireless Bill** and **Wireless and the Amateur**).  Once the influential science fiction historian and Gernsback's friend Sam Moskowitz recorded these stories in his many profiles of Gernsback, they became established as gospel truth, with Moskowitz playing the apostle to Gernsback's prophecies.  Evidence contrary to or even in excess of the received doxa is hard to come by, with many press and literary critical accounts barely rephrasing Moskowitz's prose.^[Beginning with @moskowitz_hugo_1959.]

We do know that despite the precociousness of his youth, Gernsback was by most measures a terrible student, falling at the bottom of his class at an industrial school near home from the ages of twelve to fifteen.  When he left to attend the Technikum in Bingen, Germany (now the Fachhochschule Bingen) from seventeen to eighteen, he regularly skipped classes and received poor grades in all subjects save electricity and physics.  It was during these teenage years that Gernsback acquired a penchant for gambling with the money he earned doing various electrical jobs in poker games, though his tendency to be cleaned out by older players seemed to keep him from falling too deep into this habit.^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 15.]  Outside of school, Gernsback was drawn to American culture from an early age.  He was a fan of John Philip Sousa's military marches and even composed his own patriotic Luxembourgish piece in the style of Sousa titled *Rǒd, Wêis, Blo* that continued to be performed by the Military Band at the Place d'Armes in Luxembourg into the 1930s.^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 15-16.]  He was a devoted reader of cowboy stories and was such a fan of Mark Twain that he wrote a now-lost novel of his own at seventeen, *Der Pechvogel,* under the name Huck Gernsbacher.  But it was stories of the otherworldly that truly fired his imagination.  Reading the astronomer Percival Lowell's book *Mars* at the age of nine, with its fusion of the hard sciences and speculation about alien life, served as Gernsback's introduction to the literature he would later come to think of as a distinct genre of scientifiction.  He dove headfirst into the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, claiming to have nearly memorized many of their novels while still very young.^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 229.]

Despite his predilection for journeys into unknown frontiers, whether the American West or Martian canals, Gernsback remained tied to his home even after leaving, if not physically -- there is no proof he ever returned -- then through a meticulous self-fashioning.  Gernsback cultivated a distinctively (one might say distinctively unique) Luxembourgish identity throughout his life.  Though raised by German parents, he grew up in Luxembourg at a moment in which the tiny country's national identity was becoming more developed than ever before.  The anti-German sentiments of Gernsback's editorials and short fiction published during World War I (especially **The Magnetic Storm**) largely echo the growing importance already sensed by "a good part of the Luxembourgish people at the end of the Nineteenth century to demarcate between the two [Germany and Luxembourg] when faced with the more or less well marked pan-Germanic designs of Germany."^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 19.]  But the many identities attributed to Gernsback throughout his life -- he is described variously in the press as Prussian, German, Belgian, French, a "multilingual dandy"^[@oneil_amazing_1963.] -- also seemed to allow him a kind of ambiguity that he relished.

> In the era of tie-dye and sandals, Gernsback continued to dress like a visiting dignitary. For evenings on the town, he favored formal wear, including spats, an opera cape and an expensive silk homburg. He even affected a monocle, though he didn't really need it.^[@stashower_dreamer_1990.]

But hiding just beneath this severe exterior, according to Sam Moskowitz, was a sharp sense of humor:  "The truth is that Gernsback socially is a man of almost rapier-like wit, with a mischievous gleam in his eyes and with the rare ability to joke about his own misfortunes."^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 235.]  Throughout his life, friends and colleagues noted Gernsback's relentless energy and the way that it seemed to sweep up everyone around him.  Visions completely out of step with his surroundings seemed to fall out of him wherever he went.  A distant relative recalls a 1910 visit from Gernsback on his way to Chicago to purchase new equipment for Electro Importing.  When a ringing telephone interrupted one of his many stories of "robot doctors, retirement colonies on Mars, domed cities orbiting Earth," Gernsback (who had arrived in a horse-drawn carriage) reminded his seven-year-old niece as she ran toward the receiver, "Hildegarde, fix your hair. It won't be long before the caller can see your face over the telephone wires."^[@stashower_dreamer_1990.]]]

Throughout his youth, Gernsback's parents never approved of his interest in electrics, and especially didn't see it as a viable career choice for him.  But when Moritz died in 1903 at the age of 57, Gernsback sensed that it was time to branch out on his own.  With either his share of the family's money or the savings from his electrical installation work (depending on which version of the story one finds), he booked a first class ticket to the United States, a fare that was prohibitively expensive for most.^[@gernsback_old_1938]  In February 1904, he arrived in New York by himself at the age of 19, in an elaborate three piece suit.  Perhaps inspired by his first experiences with that Leclanché cell as a boy, Gernsback carried with him the design for a new kind of dry cell battery whose electrolytic paste could replace the inefficient liquid of wet cells like that of the Leclanché.  Having been denied patents in both France and Germany for the battery, Gernsback decided to try his luck in the United States.  A year later, he began publishing on his ideas, with his first printed article appearing in *Scientific American* again under that most American of names, "Huck" (**A New Interrupter**).  He was able to sell his battery technology to the Packard Motor Car Company, who ended up using the device in their ignition systems.  With the profits of his sale, Gernsback formed the Electro Importing Company, an importer of specialized electrical equipment from Europe and one of the first mail-order radio retailers in the country.  Through their catalog and retail store at 84 West Broadway, the company provided access to specialized wireless and electrical equipment not found anywhere outside of Europe.  Electro Importing catered to a diverse clientele, first manufacturing the Telimco in 1905 for their novice users, and providing their more advanced amateur experimenters with the first vacuum tube offered for sale to the general public in 1911.

![Electro Importing Company store, c. 1908.](images/eico_store.png)

After several issues of their mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, Electro Importing began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor. Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog evolved into a monthly magazine for the wireless homebrewer, *Modern Electrics* in 1908.  The transition from the mail-order catalog to the monthly magazine format was a smooth one, evidenced by the fact that the third and fourth editions (1907 and 1908) of the Electro Importing catalog bears the title of the new full-format magazine, "Modern Electrics."  The offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company, founded in 1915, published expanded how-to manuals, pamphlets, and complete books like *The Wireless Telephone,* *One Thousand and One Formulas,* and *The Wireless Course.*  While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, throughout Europe, and in Gernsback's own company offices.  Each 36-page, 6 x 9.5" issue sold on newsstands for ten cents and contained regular reports from E.I. Co. employees like Harry Winfield Secor and René Homer, who would contribute to Gernsback titles for years to come.  Some freelancers attributed their decision to pursue science as a profession to their experiences with *Modern Electrics,* as did Donald H. Menzel, later director of the Harvard Observatory, who earned money for college by writing for the magazine.^[@oneil_amazing_1963.]  Celebrity guest contributors like Lee De Forest, and later Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla in the pages of *Electrical Experimenter,* raised the profile of the magazine among a readership hoping to emulate the success of these famous inventors.^[Tesla first published his autobiography in serial installments in *Electrical Experimenter,* a book that was recently republished by Penguin Classics. @tesla_my_2011.]  Regular dispatches and photographs printed on the magazine's slick paper from the unnamed Paris, Berlin, and Brussels Correspondents kept readers informed on developments in television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

But the hallmark of the magazine became its more speculative articles, those that were willing to extrapolate fantastic scenarios out of the technical details at hand.  Gernsback and his contributors wrote as if the more detail a particular technology's description contained, the more plausible were the projections of its future possibilities.  There was a way in which the future stood as the horizon of technical description.  As Lewis Mumford wrote in his autobiography, "In my youth, as a zealous reader of Hugo Gernsback's *Modern Electrics,* I shared my generation's pious belief in our future."^[Quoted in @westfahl_hugo_2007, 62.]  In **Signaling to Mars,** for example, Gernsback detailed the conditions that would have to be met in order for Earth to send messages via wireless telegraph to the red planet.  The quantitative description of the transmitting apparatus in terms of its necessary output (a gargantuan 70,000 kilowatts) and best time of year to signal (summer) only constitutes one aspect of this scenario.  Gernsback goes on to take into account the nature of Martian intelligence that would be necessary for such a communicative circuit to be completed:

> we can only hope that the Martians are further advanced than we and may signal back to us, using a method new to us and possibly long discarded by them, when thousands of years ago they stopped signaling to us, and gave us up, as we did not have intelligence enough to understand.

Continuing in the tradition of astronomers Percival Lowell and William Henry Pickering---the latter of whom offered a similar proposal on the front page of *The New York Times* to communicate with Mars using a series of mirrors^[@_planned_1909]---the projection of Martian technology (not to mention ecology) provided a topos upon which readers might asses the direction of its terrestrial analogues.

For readers of *Modern Electrics*, the technical context in which this highly speculative article appeared only lent credence to an idea as fanciful as the one that contact with an alien civilization was right around the corner. In the copy of this issue at Princeton University's Firestone Library, someone inserted a newspaper clipping (now a permanently affixed leaf within the bound volume) that tells of a new distance record for wireless signaling, from San Francisco to the Pacific Mail Line steamship Korea as it made its way across the ocean. Left there as if to vouch for the plausibility of the idea that we'll soon be able to connect with our nearest planetary neighbor, the clipping provides a wonderful sense of how it was people read these magazines.[^clp]  Though the Gernsback titles eventually became notable for some of their more outlandish claims---that electric current might clean us better than water, that the success of a marriage can be predicted using gadgets assembled out of various household supplies---they were always presented through a lens of supposedly scientific rationality. This frame affected the reception of the magazines by their readers, the design ethos that grew up around them, and the kind of fiction they eventually produced.

[^clp]: While I haven't been able to determine the provenance of this particular clipping, other articles reporting on the Korea's distance signaling record were published in the *New York Times*on November 8, 1909 and the *Boston Evening Transcript*, November 6, 1909.

From the earliest of the Gernsback titles, we find science configured as an instrumentalized form of technological achievement that bore little relationship to what was happening in laboratories.  Contrary to the common division between the purely theoretical nature of the sciences and their application in the development of new technologies, Gernsback argues that science and invention are part of a continuum in a later editorial for a magazine of that title:

> The word *Science,* from the Latin *scientia,* meaning knowledge, is closely related to *Invention,* which, derived from the Latin *inventio,* means, finding out.  There is little in Science that did not at one time require some inventive powers, while conversely most of the world's inventions are based upon one or more of the sciences.  (**Science and Invention**)

This article is a key of sorts for the many valences *science* can take throughout the Gernsback magazines.  Science is the sum of its many products progressively connecting the modern world, a hybrid of science and technology that saw no distinction between theories and their application.  It is defined as what the average person understands of its growing presence in their daily life:  "science no longer is the sombre book closed with seven seals.  Quite the contrary, it is the public that popularizes science---not our scientists" (**Science and Invention**).  It is even configured as a form of belief when Gernsback argues that skepticism is an entirely unscientific attitude:

> But our *real* scientists are as backward as in Galileo's times.  The public applauds and instantly believes in anything new that is scientific, whereas the true scientist scoffs and jeers, just as he did in Galileo's times when that worthy stoutly maintained that the earth moved and did not stand still.

In many ways, this starry-eyed fanaticism for science as the sum of its progressive advance in the material world reflects the way in which the public discourse was shifting on a larger scale as science entered mass market newsstands, corporate research facilities, and public school classrooms.  As John Rudolph has argued, it was during this period that the "scientific method" emerged not among professional or academic researchers but in secondary school pedagogy:

> while the manner in which practicing scientists went about their work (the research strategies they used, their modes of inquiry, norms of argumentation, etc.) changed relatively little if at all from the 1880s to the 1920s, portrayals of the scientific method in American schools underwent a marked transformation.^[@rudolph_epistemology_2005.] 

If science was a highly variable concept for Gernsback, discourse surrounding its application was just as muddled.  *Technology* was a word largely unknown to the English speaker, which should also complicate the way we read these essays.  So, for instance, when Gernsback writes in 1922 that "steam, electricity, and up-to-date technic have completely altered not only the face of the globe, but our very lives as well," the usage of the word *technic* where we might expect something like *technology* reflects an important terminological confusion at the time (**10,000 Years Hence**).  While Google Ngram shows *technic* being used over three times more often than *technology* in 1922, this situation changes rapidly over the next decade.  In nineteenth-century English, according to Eric Schatzberg, *technology* referred to "a field of study concerned with the practical arts; except in anomalous usage, [it] did not refer to industrial processes or artifacts."  Just as sociology names the study of society, technology was the science of technique, making, the useful or practical arts.  Somewhere around 1930, Schatzberg argues, 

> new meanings derived primarily from the writings of American social scientists who imported elements of the German discourse of *Technik* into the English term technology, thus shifting the latter from its original definition as the science or study of the useful arts to a new one that embraced the industrial arts as a whole, including the material means of production.^[This masterful history of the interrelated concepts of *Technik,* technology, and technique, is highly recommended.  @schatzberg_technik_2006.]

This hybridized and highly materialist understanding of science and technology was foundational for Gernsback's later conceptualization of scientifiction.

Hoping to build on the success of *Modern Electrics,* Gernsback sold the magazine to the competing publisher of *Electrician and Mechanic* and launched a new title in May 1913: *Electrical Experimenter.*[^psmm]  Continuing the work that began with *Modern Electrics's* monthly radio set building contest and correspondence section, *Electrical Experimenter* introduced several new ways for readers to participate.  A section called "The Constructor" included tips for the home workshop, like a technique for tightly winding a spark coil using a hand-cranked drill.  The "How-To-Make-It Department" offered prizes for designs submitted by readers that specifically "accomplishing new things with old apparatus and old material," such as an alarm that activated a simple electric bell in the house when a mailbox's door was opened and closed.  The "Electrical Magazine Review" provided a roundup of news recently published in other electrical magazines like *Electrical World* and London's *The Electrician,* while the "Patent Advice" column offered input on inventions that readers hoped to patent at the price of $1 per question.  By May 1918, the magazine had reached a circulation of a hundred thousand copies per month, almost doubling *Modern Electrics's* readership seven years previously.

[^psmm]: *Modern Electrics* continued under new ownership as *Modern Electrics and Mechanics* for two years before acquiring and taking on the name of *Popular Science Monthly* in April 1915, a magazine whose publishers were looking to update the format it had run since 1872: reprints of European science periodicals with little to no illustration.  Under the editorship of Waldemar Kaempffert, the new *Popular Science* tried to increase its readership with short form writing, dense photo spreads packed onto every page, and a far more generalist approach to "science."  One would now find articles on developments in criminology, warfare, and motion pictures in a magazine that only a year earlier covered entomology, evolution, and pathology.  It continues to be published today.  For an overview of Kaempffert's editorial philosophy, see @kaempffert_vision_1916.

Paging through the print run of the *Electrical Experimenter* across the 1910s is like watching the activities of a quirky group of hobbyists grow into a mass cultural phenomenon.  Over the course of its publication, Gernsback and his staff gradually widened their focus from the highly specialized electrical arts of *Modern Electrics* to a range of topics geared more toward the general public.  As "recipes, wrinkles, and formulas" were joined by sensational depictions of future technologies, Gernsback changed the magazine's tagline from "The Electrical Magazine for the Experimenter" to "The Electrical Magazine for Everybody."  By the decade's end, the title was completely rebranded as *Science and Invention,* a change that once again nearly doubled the magazine's circulation to almost 200,000 copies per month.^[*Science and Invention* continued for another decade before being bought out and merged into the September 1931 issue of *Popular Mechanics,* another title still published today.]  The new look was accompanied by a significant change in editorial policy, beginning with the idea that the image is the most effective way to communicate complicated scientific information to the public.  

> All of our departments, as you will note, have been reduced to pictures and captions, with the exception of our scientific fiction stories which for the time being will run on as usual.  The reason is that the average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of text of scientific facts, which means concentration and study. . . . *we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study.* (**The 'New' Science and Invention**)

Gernsback's visions were lent a shape and a color thanks to two new illustrators who were able to "illustrate difficult subjects in such a way that words really become superfluous," as Gernsback put it in the previous editorial.  Though Howard V. Brown's career as a cover artist spanned a variety of subjects and techniques -- his work appeared everywhere from from *Scientific American* to *Argosy All-Story Weekly* to the children's magazine *St. Nicholas* -- the signature of his Gernsback covers was the Rockwellesque way he was able to tell the story of an entirely speculative technology through facial expressions and dramatic gestures.^[@gustafon_brown_2015.]  Seemingly familiar domestic scenes, detailed in vividly realistic brush strokes, were punctured by the presence of a strange apparatus and became the starting point for conversations on how a technology of the future might function.  It was in no small part due to the vivid illustrations that readers were so drawn to these visions of the future.  As a character in Robert A. Heinlein's 1940 short story "Requiem" says, he was one of those fans "who thought there was more romance in an issue of the *Electrical Experimenter* than in all the books Dumas ever wrote."^[Quoted in @erisman_stratemeyer_2000.]

The shape of media to come took on an iconography all its own through the illustrations of Frank R. Paul.  Trained in Vienna, London, and Paris as an architectural draftsman, Paul is known for his exquisitely detailed cityscapes as well as the bug-eyed monsters that would later adorn the covers of *Amazing Stories.*^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 234.]  

* * * * * * * * 

Gernsback says that producing realistic illustrations of the future is the most difficult, and most rewarding part of the magazine, and that the idea is to fire the imagination of a reader/experimenter:  "It is no easy matter to think out new things of the future and illustrating them adequately by means of expensive washdrawings or three-color cover illustrations.  Indeed, there is nothing more difficult connected with the publication." (**Imagination Versus Facts**)

As the magazines in which they appeared gained a wider following, these images began to circulate far beyond their original venues.  Plans for the Osophone, a device Gernsback designed to replace headphones by transmitting sound through vibrations in the jawbone of the listener (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**), were published and reviewed in the German journal *Der Radio-Amateur.*^[@nesper_osophon_1924.  For the history of *Der Radio-Amateur* magazine, see @sarkowski_springer-verlag_1996.]  Paul's sketch of a man using a tuning fork to calibrate the speed of the 1928 *Science and Invention* Nipkow disk television receiver was republished the following year in the Chinese film journal *Yingxi zazhi* (*Shadow Play Magazine*) as an illustration of recent research into television, what was referred to in the article as, directly translated, "wireless cinema."^[@bao_sympathetic_2011. Bao located Paul's illustration of the *Science and Invention* television receiver in @shen_dianyingjie_1929. The term for television used in this article is "wuxian dianying (wireless cinema, or, more literally, wireless electric shadow, or radio shadow)." Paul's images were originally published as the accompaniment to @gernsback_radio_1928.]  Many more *Electrical Experimenter / Science and Invention* articles were translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, and Arabic, circulating widely along with their illustrations.^[@_this_1919]

![*Science and Invention* illustrations republished in Chinese film journal *Yingxi Zazhi*.](images/shadow_play_mag.jpg)

It's the wide currency of these images then and now (especially as they're given new life as retrofuturist visions circulating on Twitter and Tumblr) that perhaps has resulted in the description of Gernsback for better or worse as a "prophet" of the future.  Unfortunately, this approach tends to flatten out the richness of his work into a list of the impressively early dates by which he had described the coming of technologies like in vitro fertilization, the transistor radio, atomic war, education by video, and telemedicine.  Gernsback himself seemed to enjoy the continued notoriety these predictions brought him (yet another reason why, in writing about him, we have to be careful to cut through the self-image he crafted).  In a sense, their sheer number is of course impressive, as it was for Arthur C. Clarke who dedicated his *Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible* "to Hugo Gernsback, who thought of everything."[^prdt]  Though many of these ideas were in the air at the time, Gernsback simply had a knack for tuning in like no other, for distilling the essence of a technosocial development from a cloud of diverse possibilities into a sleek, attractive form.

[^prdt]: Moskowitz lists the predictions in *Ralph 124C 41+* alone: "Fluorescent lighting, skywriting, automatic packaging machines, plastics, the radio directional range finder, juke boxes, liquid fertilizer, hydroponics, tape recorders, rustproof steel, loud speakers, night baseball, aquacades, microfilm, television, radio networks, vending machines dispensing hot and cold foods and liquids, flying saucers, a device for teaching while the user is asleep, solar energy for theat and power, fabrics from glass, synthetic materials such as nylon for wearing apparel, and, of course, space travel are but a few." @moskowitz_explorers_1963, 233.

![A Frank R. Paul caricature of the *Electrical Experimenter* newsroom from the April 1920 issue.](images/ee_newsroom.jpg)

But descriptions of Gernsback as a prophet miss the way in which these imminent futures felt so close to hand thanks to a collective endeavor among contributing writers, assistant editors, illustrators, and readers.  Throughout his writings, Gernsback relies on input from readers, quoting them sometimes at great length.  As his magazines began to grow in both number and circulation, Gernsback inceasingly delegated work to assistant editors like T. O’Conor Sloane, C.A. Brandt, Wilbur C. Whitehead, and Charles Hornig.  While Gernsback wrote under a number of pseudonyms for *Modern Electrics* when he still didn't have many contributors, over time this situation was apparently reversed, with "Gernsback" operating as a kind of collective editorial voice by the time of the science fiction magazines.  As Justine Larbalestier writes, 

> Gernsback did not necessarily write all or even the majority of the editorial comments during the periods in which he was the publisher and editor of such magazines as *Amazing Stories* and *Wonder Stories* [1926-1936].  However, such is the mythic force of Gernsback, the founding father, that in the majority of the work I have read on this period he is spoken of as though he wrote every word of editorial comment in the magazines he published.  ‘Gernsback’ has come to operate as synonymous with the magazines he founded, whether he was actively contributing to them or not.^[@larbalestier_battle_2002, p. 17.  Larbalestier cites @tymn_science_1985 and @clute_encyclopedia_1995.]

E.F. and Richard Bleiler report that "Charles Hornig claims to have written Gernsback's editorials while editor of *Wonder Stories,* and the same situation may have existed earlier."^[@bleiler_science-fiction:_1998, p. 147]  There is no telling how much of a hand Gernsback had in writing these later articles, from offering up his often clunky, non-native speaking prose for editorial revision to simply suggesting the idea of a piece to one of his assistant editors.  Manuscript versions at the Hugo Gernsback Papers in Syracuse and in the possession of private collectors show that he did, in fact, author material for the technical magazines in longhand with little revision before it went to print.  But following Larbalestier and other science fiction critics, I think that it's important to continue "

Following Larbalestier and others, I think that it's important to continue "allowing 'Gernsback' to stand for the house editorial voice."^[@larbalestier_battle_2002, p. 17.]

not just as a convenient shorthand, but as a means of tracing the many overlapping discourses on fiction, making, and science that emerged in these magazines over their thousands upon thousands of pages.  Whether Gernsback wrote every word of the later articles bearing his name or merely provided editorial input, we are left with the record of a new kind of conversation on technology among a growing community of participants.  Gernsback, about whom we know little outside of the self-propagated myths, is thus best understood as a representative of this moment that falls between the gaps of literary and technological history, a distillation of what was in the air at the moment.  To make Gernsback synonymous with his magazines, each of which was highly responsive to the interests and activities of its readership, is to follow the voice of the community that developed over the course of three decades.

These articles are a starting point, and I have treated them as such in the annotations throughout.
