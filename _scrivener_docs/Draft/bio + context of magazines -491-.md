"up-to-date technic"

===================

Born Hugo Gernsbacher in 1884, the third son of Jewish German émigrés to Luxembourg, Gernsback was raised in Hollerich, a tiny suburb of the nation's capital.  His parents, Moritz and Bertha Gernsbacher (née Dürlacher), raised him in comfortable circumstances thanks to Moritz's successful wine wholesaling business.  Growing up off the grid (Hollerich wasn't yet connected to Luxembourg City's new electricity network), the young Gernsback's passion for technology began with the battery after a handyman employed by his father, Jean-Pierre Görgen, taught him at six years old how to wire a series of bells to a Leclanché cell.  Gernsback recalls being instantly enchanted by the bell "ringing amid a shower of wonderful green sparks," and would soon acquire a reputation for wiring homes and businesses in the area with telephones and these ringers.^[@oneil_amazing_1963. @gernsback_old_1938.]  According to a story he often told later in life, Gernsback received special permission from Pope Leo XIII at thirteen years old to enter the Carmelite convent of Luxembourg City to install a series of electric call bells for the nuns there.^[@siegel_hugo_1988, 16.]

Though this story is partially verifiable through a certificate of thanks from the Convent found by the Luxembourgeois Centre National de Littérature, it's worth pointing out here that the portrait of Gernsback's life we are left with in the historical record consists largely of a series of self-propagated stories that border on braggadocio:  that a police officer intruded on the Electro Importing Company offices to interrogate them for fraud with the Telimco set in 1906, for "no wireless combination could be sold at this low price"^[Reportedly, the officer shot back after the demonstration: "I still think youse guys is a bunch of fakers. This ad here says that you are selling a *wireless* machine. Well, if you do, what are all them wires for? @gernsback_old_1938.]; that Gernsback coined the term "television" in his December 1909 editorial **Television and the Telephot** (he didn't); that his recommendations were incorporated "word for word" into the Radio Act of 1912 (while the recommendation was, the wording wasn't---see **The Alexander Wireless Bill** and *Wireless and the Amateur**).  Once the influential science fiction historian and Gernsback's friend Sam Moskowitz recorded these stories in his many profiles of Gernsback, they became established as gospel truth, with Moskowitz playing the apostle to Gernsback's prophecies.  Evidence contrary to or even in excess of the received doxa is hard to come by, with many press and literary critical accounts barely rephrasing Moskowitz's prose.^[Beginning with @moskowitz_hugo_1959.]

We do know that despite the precociousness of his youth, Gernsback was by most measures a terrible student, falling at the bottom of his class at an industrial school near home from the ages of twelve to fifteen.  When he left to attend the Technikum in Bingen, Germany (now the Fachhochschule Bingen) from seventeen to eighteen, he regularly skipped classes and received poor grades in all subjects save electricity and physics.  It was during these teenage years that Gernsback acquired a penchant for gambling with the money he earned doing various electrical jobs in poker games, though his tendency to be cleaned out by older players seemed to keep him from falling too deep into this habit.^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 15.]  Outside of school, Gernsback was drawn to American culture from an early age.  He was a fan of John Philip Sousa's military marches and even composed his own patriotic Luxembourgish piece in the style of Sousa titled *Rǒd, Wêis, Blo* that continued to be performed by the Military Band at the Place d'Armes in Luxembourg into the 1930s.^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 15-16.]  He was a devoted reader of cowboy stories and was such a fan of Mark Twain that he wrote a now-lost novel of his own at seventeen, *Der Pechvogel,* under the name Huck Gernsbacher.  But it was stories of the otherworldly that truly fired his imagination.  Reading the astronomer Percival Lowell's book *Mars* at the age of nine, with its fusion of the hard sciences and speculation about alien life, served as Gernsback's introduction to the literature he would later come to think of as a distinct genre of scientifiction.  He dove headfirst into the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, claiming to have nearly memorized many of their novels while still very young.^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 229.]

Despite his predilection for journeys into unknown frontiers, whether the American West or Martian canals, Gernsback remained tied to his home even after leaving, if not physically -- there is no proof he ever returned -- then through a meticulous self-fashioning.  Gernsback cultivated a distinctively (one might say distinctively unique) Luxembourgish identity throughout his life.  Though raised by German parents, he grew up in Luxembourg at a moment in which the tiny country's national identity was becoming more developed than ever before.  The anti-German sentiments of Gernsback's editorials and short fiction published during World War I (especially **The Magnetic Storm**) largely reflect the growing importance sensed by "a good part of the Luxembourgish people at the end of the Nineteenth century to demarcate between the two [Germany and Luxembourg] when faced with the more or less well marked pan-Germanic designs of Germany."^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 19.]  But the many identities attributed to Gernsback throughout his life -- he is described variously in the press as Prussian, German, Belgian, French, a "multilingual dandy" -- also seemed to allow him a kind of ambiguity that he relished.

> In the era of tie-dye and sandals, Gernsback continued to dress like a visiting dignitary. For evenings on the town, he favored formal wear, including spats, an opera cape and an expensive silk homburg. He even affected a monocle, though he didn't really need it.^[@stashower_dreamer_1990.]

Despite the seeming seriousness of his demeanor, Sam Moskowitz testifies to Gernsback's sharp sense of humor:  "The truth is that Gernsback socially is a man of almost rapier-like wit, with a mischievous gleam in his eyes and with the rare ability to joke about his own misfortunes."^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 235.]  Throughout his life, friends and colleagues commented on Gernsback's relentless energy and the way that it seemed to sweep up everyone around him.

Because Gernsback's parents didn't approve of his interest in electrics, Gernsback booked a first class ticket to the United States using the savings from his electrical installation work, even though such a ticket was prohibitively expensive for most.^[@gernsback_old_1938]  In February 1904, he arrived in New York by himself at the age of 19, in an elaborate three piece suit.  Perhaps inspired by his first experiences with that Leclanché cell as a boy, Gernsback carried with him the design for a new kind of dry cell battery whose electrolytic paste could replace the inefficient liquid of wet cells like that of the Leclanché.  Having been denied patents in both France and Germany for the battery, Gernsback decided to try his luck in the United States.  A year later, he began publishing on his ideas, with his first printed article appearing in *Scientific American* again under that most American of names, "Huck" (**A New Interrupter**).  He was able to sell his battery technology to the Packard Motor Car Company, who ended up using the device in their ignition systems.  With the profits of his sale, Gernsback formed the Electro Importing Company, an importer of specialized electrical equipment from Europe and one of the first mail-order radio retailers in the country.  Through their catalog and retail store at 84 West Broadway, the company provided access to specialized wireless and electrical equipment not found anywhere outside of Europe.  Electro Importing catered to a diverse clientele, first manufacturing the Telimco in 1905 for their novice users, and providing their more advanced amateur experimenters with the first vacuum tube offered for sale to the general public in 1911.

After several issues of their mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, Electro Importing began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor. Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog evolved into a monthly magazine for the wireless homebrewer, *Modern Electrics* in 1908.  The transition from the mail-order catalog to the monthly magazine format was a smooth one, evidenced by the fact that the third and fourth editions (1907 and 1908) of the Electro Importing catalog bears the title of the new full-format magazine, "Modern Electrics."  The offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company, founded in 1915, published expanded how-to manuals, pamphlets, and complete books like *The Wireless Telephone,* *One Thousand and One Formulas,* and *The Wireless Course.*  While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, throughout Europe, and in Gernsback's own company offices.  Each 36-page, 6 x 9.5" issue sold on newsstands for ten cents and contained regular reports from E.I. Co. employees like H. Winfield Secor and René Homer, who would contribute to Gernsback titles for years to come.  Some freelancers attributed their decision to pursue science as a profession to their experiences with *Modern Electrics,* as did Donald H. Menzel, later director of the Harvard Observatory, who earned money for college by writing for the magazine.^[@oneil_amazing_1963.]  Celebrity guest contributors like Lee De Forest, and later Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla in the pages of *Electrical Experimenter,* raised the profile of the magazine among a readership hoping to emulate the success of these famous inventors.^[Tesla first published his autobiography in serial installments in *Electrical Experimenter,* a book that was recently republished by Penguin Classics. @tesla_my_2011.]  Regular dispatches and photographs printed on the magazine's slick paper from the unnamed Paris, Berlin, and Brussels Correspondents kept readers informed on developments in television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

But the hallmark of the magazine became its more speculative articles, those that were willing to extrapolate fantastic scenarios out of the technical details at hand.  Gernsback and his contributors wrote as if the more detail a particular technology's description contained, the more plausible were the projections of its future possibilities.  There was a way in which the future stood as the horizon of technical description.  As Lewis Mumford wrote in his autobiography, "In my youth, as a zealous reader of Hugo Gernsback's *Modern Electrics,* I shared my generation's pious belief in our future."^[Quoted in @westfahl_hugo_2007, 62.]  In **Signaling to Mars,** for example, Gernsback detailed the conditions that would have to be met in order for Earth to send messages via wireless telegraph to the red planet.  The quantitative description of the transmitting apparatus in terms of its necessary output (a gargantuan 70,000 kilowatts) and best time of year to signal (summer) only constitutes one aspect of this scenario.  Gernsback goes on to take into account the nature of Martian intelligence that would be necessary for such a communicative circuit to be completed:

> we can only hope that the Martians are further advanced than we and may signal back to us, using a method new to us and possibly long discarded by them, when thousands of years ago they stopped signaling to us, and gave us up, as we did not have intelligence enough to understand.

Continuing in the tradition of astronomers Percival Lowell and William Henry Pickering---the latter of whom offered a similar proposal on the front page of *The New York Times* to communicate with Mars using a series of mirrors^[@_planned_1909]---the projection of Martian technology (not to mention ecology) provided a topos upon which readers might asses the direction of its terrestrial analogues.

For readers of *Modern Electrics*, the technical context in which this highly speculative article appeared only lent credence to an idea as fanciful as the one that contact with an alien civilization was right around the corner. In the copy of this issue at Princeton University's Firestone Library, someone inserted a newspaper clipping (now a permanently affixed leaf within the bound volume) that tells of a new distance record for wireless signaling, from San Francisco to the Pacific Mail Line steamship Korea as it made its way across the ocean. Left there as if to vouch for the plausibility of the idea that we'll soon be able to connect with our nearest planetary neighbor, the clipping provides a wonderful sense of how it was people read these magazines.[^clp]  Though the Gernsback titles eventually became notable for some of their more outlandish claims---that electric current might clean us better than water, that the success of a marriage can be predicted using gadgets assembled out of various household supplies---they were always presented through a lens of supposedly scientific rationality. This frame affected the reception of the magazines by their readers, the design ethos that grew up around them, and the kind of fiction they eventually produced.

[^clp]: While I haven't been able to determine the provenance of this particular clipping, other articles reporting on the Korea's distance signaling record were published in the *New York Times*on November 8, 1909 and the *Boston Evening Transcript*, November 6, 1909.

From the earliest of the Gernsback titles, we find science configured as an instrumentalized form of technological achievement that bore little relationship to what was happening in laboratories.  Contrary to the now-accepted division between the purely theoretical nature of the sciences and their application in the development of new technologies, Gernsback argues that science and invention are part of a continuum in a later editorial for a magazine of that title:

> The word *Science,* from the Latin *scientia,* meaning knowledge, is closely related to *Invention,* which, derived from the Latin *inventio,* means, finding out.  There is little in Science that did not at one time require some inventive powers, while conversely most of the world's inventions are based upon one or more of the sciences.  (**Science and Invention**)

This article is a key of sorts for the many valences *science* can take throughout the Gernsback magazines.  Science is the sum of its many products progressively connecting the modern world, a hybrid of science and technology that saw no distinction between theories and their application.  It is defined as what the average person understands of its growing presence in their daily life:  "science no longer is the sombre book closed with seven seals.  Quite the contrary, it is the public that popularizes science---not our scientists" (**Science and Invention**).  It is even configured as a form of belief when he writes that skepticism is an entirely unscientific attitude:

> But our *real* scientists are as backward as in Galileo's times.  The public applauds and instantly believes in anything new that is scientific, whereas the true scientist scoffs and jeers, just as he did in Galileo's times when that worthy stoutly maintained that the earth moved and did not stand still.

In many ways, this starry-eyed fanaticism for science as the sum of its progressive advance in the material world reflects the way in which the public discourse was shifting on a larger scale as science entered mass market newsstands, corporate research facilities, and public school classrooms.  As John Rudolph has argued, it was during this period that the "scientific method" emerged not among communities of researchers but in secondary school pedagogy:

> while the manner in which practicing scientists went about their work (the research strategies they used, their modes of inquiry, norms of argumentation, etc.) changed relatively little if at all from the 1880s to the 1920s, portrayals of the scientific method in American schools underwent a marked transformation.^[@rudolph_epistemology_2005.] 

If science was a highly variable concept for Gernsback, discourse surrounding its application was just as muddled.  *Technology* was a word largely unknown to the English speaker, which should also complicate the way we read these essays.  So, for instance, when Gernsback writes in 1922 that "steam, electricity, and up-to-date technic have completely altered not only the face of the globe, but our very lives as well," the usage of the word *technic* where we might expect something like *technology* reflects an important terminological confusion at the time (**10,000 Years Hence**).  While Google Ngram shows *technic* being used over three times more often than *technology* in 1922, this situation changes rapidly over the next decade.  In nineteenth-century English, according to Eric Schatzberg, *technology* referred to "a field of study concerned with the practical arts; except in anomalous usage, [it] did not refer to industrial processes or artifacts."  Just as sociology names the study of society, technology was the science of technique, making, the useful or practical arts.  Somewhere around 1930, Schatzberg argues, 

> new meanings derived primarily from the writings of American social scientists who imported elements of the German discourse of *Technik* into the English term technology, thus shifting the latter from its original definition as the science or study of the useful arts to a new one that embraced the industrial arts as a whole, including the material means of production.^[This masterful history of the interrelated concepts of *Technik,* technology, and technique, is highly recommended.  @schatzberg_technik_2006.]

A hybridized and highly material, everyday understanding of science and technology in these early technology magazines was foundational for Gernsback's conceptualization of scientifiction, as we will see later.

on amateur experimenter culture, boys hoping to get rich

	Parents eager to set their children on the right path bought them chemistry sets with names like Chemcraft, produced by the Porter Chemical Company, which also sponsored Chemists Clubs.  Young adult books on electricity and technology flourished, many of them written for boys and intended to instill the noble desire to invent.  Who knew when the next Edison or Morse might arrive on the scene to offer up the world a truly wonderful practical miracle?” (Schlesinger, loc 2808)

Hoping to build on the success of *Modern Electrics,* Gernsback sold the magazine to Orland Ridenour in early 1913 and launched a new title in May 1913: *Electrical Experimenter.*[^psmm]  In addition to the successful correspondence section with readers, radio set building contests, and patent application news, *Electrical Experimenter* began including monthly departments like The Constructor, which included tips, "wrinkles and recipes" for the workshop like how to tightly wind a spark coil using a hand-cranked drill.  The "How-To-Make-It Department" offered prizes for designs submitted by readers that "accomplishing new things with old apparatus and old material," such as an alarm that activated a simple electric bell in the house when a mailbox's door was opened and closed.  The "Electrical Magazine Review" provided a roundup of news recently published in other electrical magazines like *Electrical World* and London's *The Electrician,* while the "Patent Advice" column offered input on inventions that readers hoped to patent at the price of $1 per question.  By May 1918, the magazine had achieved a circulation of a hundred thousand copies per month, almost doubling *Modern Electrics's* readership seven years previously.

[^psmm]: *Modern Electrics* continued under Ridenour's Modern Publishing Company as *Modern Electrics and Mechanics* for two years before acquiring and taking on the name of *Popular Science Monthly* in April 1915, a magazine whose publishers were looking to update the format it had run since 1872: reprints of European science periodicals with little to no illustration.  Under the editorship of Waldemar Kaempffert, the new *Popular Science* tried to increase its readership with short form writing, photo spreads packed onto every page, and a far more generalist approach to "science."  One would now find articles on developments in criminology, warfare, and motion pictures in a magazine that only a year earlier covered entomology, evolution, and pathology.  It continues to be published today.  For an overview of Kaempffert's editorial philosophy, see @kaempffert_vision_1916.

Over the course of its publication, the *Electrical Experimenter* gradually widened its focus from the highly specialized electrical arts of *Modern Electrics* to a range of topics geared more toward the general public.  Gernsback eventually changed the magazine's tagline from "The Electrical Magazine for the Experimenter" to "The Electrical Magazine for Everybody," and beginning with the August 1920 issue rebranded the title as *Science and Invention.*  Once again, this change nearly doubled the magazine's circulation, this time to almost 200,000 copies per month by 1921 (**The 'New' Science and Invention**).^[*Science and Invention* continued for another decade before being bought out and merged into the September 1931 issue of *Popular Mechanics,* another title still published today.]  [[QUOTE "NEW SI" OR OTHER ED. ABOUT THE USE OF IMAGES TO COMMUNICATE SCIENCE]]  Much of this growing popularity was thanks to the shape and the color that two new illustrators gave to Gernsback's visions.  Though Howard V. Brown's career as a cover artist ran the gamut from from *Scientific American* to *Argosy All-Story Weekly* to the children's *St. Nicholas Magazine,* the signature of his Gernsback covers was his realistic depiction of domestic scenes revealing in a dramatic pose how a technology of the future would operate.

The shape of media to come took on an iconography all its own through the illustrations of Frank R. Paul.  Trained in Vienna, London, and Paris as an architectural draftsman, Paul is known for his exquisitely detailed cityscapes as well as his bug-eyed monsters that would later adorn the covers of *Amazing Stories.*^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 234.]

So powerful were these images that they circulated widely beyond their original publication venues in a way that has never before been given any attention. Plans for the osophone, a device Gernsback designed to replace headphones by transmitting sound through vibrations in the jawbone of the listener (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**), were published and reviewed in the German journal *Der Radio-Amateur.*^[@nesper_osophon_1924.  For the history of *Der Radio-Amateur* magazine, see @sarkowski_springer-verlag_1996.]  Paul's sketch of a man using a tuning fork to calibrate the speed of the 1928 *Science and Invention* Nipkow disk television receiver was republished the following year in the Chinese film journal *Yingxi zazhi* (*Shadow Play Magazine*) as an illustration of recent research into television, what was referred to in the article as, directly translated, "wireless cinema."^[@bao_sympathetic_2011. Bao located Paul's illustration of the *Science and Invention* television receiver in @shen_dianyingjie_1929. The term for television used in this article is "wuxian dianying (wireless cinema, or, more literally, wireless electric shadow, or radio shadow)." Paul's images were originally published as the accompaniment to @gernsback_radio_1928.]  The articles themselves were translated widely into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, and Arabic.^[@_this_1919]

"prophet"

As a figure in the history of science fiction, Gernsback is often flattened out as little more than a number of astoundingly early dates and predictions (in vitro fertilization, the transistor radio, atomic war, and education by television).  Arthur C. Clarke dedicated *Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible* "to Hugo Gernsback, who thought of everything."

These ideas were of course all "in the air," but Gernsback had a knack for tuning into them, and re-presenting them in digestible, shiny, attractive form.  (USE HG NEWSROOM CARTOON).  Texts that are in a way authorless: because HG was the house name for other editors who worked for him (see Larbaliestier); because he circulated stories about himself constantly; because those stories have largely been picked up as shorthand in SF studies when they care to mention HG as the gospel truth.  

But if you look at other popular science and electrical magazines of the period, the future is never discussed.  The future infuses everything about science and technology in these magazines.

This also flattens out the special way in which his writings tied material interaction and tinkering to a critical understanding of the future, rather than just a simple prognostication.  He organized a community that together built the future.  So, in writing about him, we have to be careful to cut through the stories he told about himself, the self-image he crafted.

Prophecy, and science compared to tinkering, making, and hands-on stuff.

But "invention" precedes science.  It is a form of instinctual know-how or "knack," a term Gernsback frequently returns to.  in **Science and Invention**

Making + the future mentioned in opening section w/ title Perversity of Things, here as a pivot point, and in the following section on tinkering.  Figure out how best to space out this story.
