Born Hugo Gernsbacher in Luxembourg in 1884, the son of a successful wine wholesaler, Gernsback was educated at the École Industrielle of Luxembourg and the Technikum in Bingen, Germany.  His passion for technology began early, with a handyman employed by his father teaching the six-year-old Gernsback how to use a Leclanché cell battery, and at thirteen “received special dispensation from Pope Leo XIII so that he could install electric call bells in the Carmelite convent of Luxembourg City.”^[@siegel_hugo_1988, p. 16]

Gernsback immigrated to the United States in 1904 at the age of 19, carrying with him the design for a new kind of dry cell battery, perhaps inspired by his first experiences with that Leclanché cell---which used a liquid or "wet" electrolyte as opposed to a "dry" paste.  

Gernsback published his first article piece of writing a year later in *Scientific American* under that most American of names, "Huck,” profiling his design for the new device.  Gernsback sold the battery patent to the Packard Motor Car Company, who ended up using technology in their ignition systems.  With the profits of his sale, Gernsback formed the Electro Importing Company, an importer of specialized electrical equipment from Europe and the first mail-order radio house in the country [MOSKOWITZ'S WORDS]. Through their catalog and retail store at 84 West Broadway in New York, the company provided access to specialized wireless and electrical equipment not found anywhere outside of Europe. Electro Importing catered to a diverse clientele, providing their more advanced basement experimenters with the first vacuum tube offered for sale to the general public in 1911, and manufacturing for their novice users in 1905 the first ever fully assembled radio set commercially available in the United States, the Telimco.

After several issues of their mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, Electro Importing began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor. Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog grew into a series of monthly magazines for the wireless homebrewer, beginning with *Modern Electrics* in 1908 and the offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company in 1915. While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, Germany, France, and in Gernsback's own company offices. Regular reporters and celebrity guest contributors like Lee De Forest, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla.^[Tesla first published his autobiography in serial installments in *Electrical Experimenter,* a book that was recently rereleased by Penguin Classics. @tesla_my_2011] provided reports on television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

All of this began with the *Electro Importing Catalog.*  Gernsback's *Modern Electrics* began as a mail-order catalogue for imported wireless parts and exotic electrical miscellany in 1905.  After several issues of the mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, *Electro Importing* began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor.  Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog grew into a series of monthly magazines for the wireless homebrewer, beginning with *Modern Electrics* in 1908 and the offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company in 1915, later expanding to a fleet of popular and specialist magazines like *Electrical Experimenter, Radio News, Science & Invention*, and the *Technocracy Review*.  The transition from the mail-order catalog to the "slick paper" monthly magazine format was a smooth one, evidenced by the fact that the third edition (1908) of the Electro Importing catalog bears the title of the new full-format magazine, "Modern Electrics."  

While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, Germany, France, and in Gernsback's own company offices.  Regular reporters like H. Winfield Secor and René Homer, celebrity guest contributors such as Lee De Forest, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla, as well as the unnamed Paris Correspondent and Berlin Correspondent provided reports on television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

But the hallmark of the magazine became its more speculative articles, those that were willing to extrapolate fantastic scenarios out of the technical details at hand. In "Signaling to Mars," Gernsback detailed the conditions that would have to obtain in order for Earth to send messages via wireless telegraph to the red planet.  The quantitative description of the transmitting apparatus in terms of its necessary output (70,000 kilowatts) and best time of year to signal (summer) only constitutes one aspect of this scenario.  Gernsback goes on to take into account the nature of Martian intelligence that would be necessary for such a communicative circuit to be completed:  "we can only hope that the Martians are further advanced than we and may signal back to us, using a method new to us and possibly long discarded by them, when thousands of years ago they stopped signaling to us, and gave us up, as we did not have intelligence enough to understand."^[@gernsback_signaling_1909]  Continuing in the tradition of Percival Lowell and William Henry Pickering---the latter of whom offered a similar proposal on the front page of *The New York Times* to communicate with Mars using a series of mirrors^[@_planned_1909]---the supposition of Martian technology (or biology, or ecology) provided a topos upon which readers might asses the direction of its terrestrial analogues.

For readers of *Modern Electrics*, the technical context in which this highly speculative article appeared only led credence to the idea that contact with an alien civilization was right around the corner. In the copy of this issue at Princeton University's Firestone Library, someone inserted a newspaper clipping (now a permanently affixed leaf within the bound volume) that tells of a new distance record for wireless signaling, from San Francisco to the Pacific Mail Line steamship Korea as it made its way across the ocean. Left there as if to vouch for the plausibility of the idea that we'll soon be able to connect with our nearest planetary neighbor, the clipping provides a wonderful sense of how it was people read these magazines.[^clp] Though the Gernsback titles eventually became infamous for their sometimes outlandish claims – that electric current might clean us better than water; that the success of a marriage can be predicted using gadgets assembled out of various household supplies – they were always presented through a lens of supposedly scientific rationality. This frame affected the reception of the magazines by their readers, the design ethos that grew up around them, and the kind of fiction they eventually produced.

[^clp]: While I haven't been able to determine the provenance of this particular article, other pieces reporting on the Korea's distance signaling record were published in the *New York Times*on November 8, 1909 and the *Boston Evening Transcript*, November 6, 1909.

The shape of media to come took on an iconography all its own through the illustrations of Frank R. Paul. Paul's depictions of gadgetry circulated widely beyond their original publication venues in a way that has never before been given any attention. Plans for the osophon, a device Gernsback designed to replace headphones by transmitting sound through vibrations in the jawbone of the listener, were published and reviewed in the German journal *Der Radio-Amateur*.^[@nesper_osophon_1924]  Paul's sketch of a man using a tuning fork to calibrate the speed of the 1928 *Science and Invention* Nipkow disk television receiver was republished the following year in the Chinese film journal *Yingxi zazhi* (*Shadow Play Magazine*) as an illustration of recent research into television, what was referred to in the article as, directly translated, "wireless cinema."^[@bao_sympathetic_2011. Bao located Paul's illustration of the *Science and Invention* television receiver in @shen_dianyingjie_1929. The term for television used in this article is "wuxian dianying (wireless cinema, or, more literally, wireless electric shadow, or radio shadow)." Paul's images were originally published in @gernsback_radio_1928.]  Paul's images, now in the public domain, accompanied Gernsback's writings and will form an important part of this collection as well.

The incredibly rich context of the science fiction's birth in Gernsback's fleet of technical publications for the amateur experimenter, as well as his work as a pioneer in media technologies and broadcasting techniques, have been entirely overlooked.  In his illustrated magazines and compendiums of amateur designs, one could find a literary treatise on what the genre of "scientifiction" should look like alongside blueprints for a homebrewed television receiver well before its commercial possibility.  Gernsback's translation of an influential German handbook titled *The Practical Electrician* ran next to a speculative article on what it would take to provide a global system of free electricity powered by ocean currents.  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines used speculative fiction to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.

*The Perversity of Things* thus seeks to provide a reappraisal of both the "hard" technical roots of American science fiction and the highly speculative orientation toward media technologies during this period.  Science fiction in its early days wasn't just a literary form, it was a mode of interacting with new media.  The literary historical gambit of this book is to recover the radical sense of openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of "scientifiction" stories who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that "Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible."  Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.

## Gernsback's reputation in the critical literature

Hugo Gernsback has been given very little attention in science fiction studies, with the field's leading critics often assuming that *Amazing Stories* was little more than a marketing gimmick for Gernsback's technical ventures.  The fiction published in the pages of his magazines is often seen to have very little aesthetic or literary value.  So when Gernsback is given credit in the foundation of modern American SF, it is as a kind of marketer of a new brand name, rather than a writer or editor.  As Alexi and Cory Panshin write, "In the pages of *Amazing*, SF literature at last became identified by a single name: 'scientifiction.' It was provided with a history. It was defined and demonstrated. It was consolidated and unified. In *Amazing*, SF became conscious of itself."^[@panshin_world_1989, 170.]  According to John Clute and Peter Nicholls, Gernsback "gave the genre a local habitation and a name," and for James Gunn, he "provided a focus for enthusiasm, for publication, for development," and bestowed science fiction with its "characteristic content, a characteristic form, and characteristic purposes."^[@clute_encyclopedia_1995, 491. @gunn_alternate_1975, 128.] 

These critical histories (each of which are written by SF novelists in their own right) proceed as if propelled by their own fantastic, alternate history: what if science fiction left us with texts as highly valued as the works of modernism from the very beginning? No doubt the field of science fiction studies has done a great deal of work in order to elevate certain works of the genre (mainly from the 1960s and 70s New Wave) to a kind of academic respectability. But these assumptions about the genre's magazine era beginnings have never been questioned, nor have any of Gernsback's publications save for *Amazing Stories* been submitted to any kind of rigorous analysis. The editorial function many SF histories begrudgingly ascribe to Gernsback overlooks the much more interesting heritage of magazine SF within a wider tradition of thinking about new media.

# Recent attention

This story has held sway over the reception of Gernsback until very recently. But the need for this volume is now becoming apparent as we experience technological revolutions in the fabric of the everyday similar to those that brought readers to the Gernsback publications a century ago.  The ability of Gernsback's ideas to speak to us today can be seen in the ways that images from his magazines circulate online through a wide variety of social image sharing sites and blogs, like Reddit, Tumblr, and the Scientific American blog *Paleofuture*. Gernsback's life and works are now beginning to receive a more formal treatment as well, with two major museum exhibits recently held: one at Luxembourg's [National Center for Literature](http://www.cnl.public.lu/agenda/2011/5/Expo_Hugo_Gernsback/index.html?highlight=gernsback) in 2011, and another in 2013 at the [ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology)](http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader8492) in Karlsruhe, curated by Franz Pichler and the media theorist Peter Weibel.^[A video of this exhibit can be seen at <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEq6Mlu9j8I>.]  In addition, the visual artist Eric Schockmel is currently developing an animated documentary film about Gernsback.

“For interwar science ficiotn, ‘amazing,’ ‘astounding,’ and ‘wonder’ were more than magazine titles; they were also metaphors for a specific style to imagine science, clarion calls for its conversation.  … Gernsback developed a view of participatory science before he began his science fiction ventures…” @cheng_astounding_2012

“In the early years of pulp science fiction magazines in the 1920s and 1930s there are not many letters that discuss what science fictiron or scientifiction is.  Everyone knew what ‘it’ was — it had something to do with ‘science’ — but everyone seemed to have a different notion of what constituted ‘science,’ what does and does not belong to the universe of science fiction and who has the rights to make these decisions.  What science fiction is, the genre, is taken for granted in the letters, but the texts, the instances of this genre, are not so defined, so that attempts to limit the field become a series of test cases about which there is not always agreement.” @larbalestier_battle_2002, 33

I was on the move yesterday. Two articles by John Rudolph (at Madison) — Epistemology for the Masses and something on general science in Chicago — will be useful. Jewett's book on science and democracy would also be good to cite. And my own work will in fact deal with this, but mostly with the c19 preconditions that led to this kind of c20 rhetoric. Is that useful? Hope all's well..

See 192310 “The New Science and Invention” on how he sees the magazine’s role in popular science

"The reason is that the average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of text of scientific facts, which means concentration and study. With fiction, however, this does not hold true because fiction is an entertainment; it does not require study. On the other hand, *we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study.*"
