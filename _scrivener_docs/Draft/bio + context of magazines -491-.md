Born Hugo Gernsbacher in 1884, the third son of Jewish German émigrés to Luxembourg, Gernsback was raised in Hollerich, a tiny suburb of the nation's capital.  His parents, Moritz and Bertha Gernsbacher (née Dürlacher), raised him in comfortable circumstances thanks to Moritz's successful wine wholesaling business.  Growing up off the grid (Hollerich wasn't yet connected to Luxembourg City's new electricity network), the young Gernsback's passion for technology began with the battery after a handyman employed by his father, Jean-Pierre Görgen, taught him at six years old how to wire a series of bells to a Leclanché cell.  Gernsback recalls being instantly enchanted by the bell "ringing amid a shower of wonderful green sparks," and would soon acquire a reputation for wiring homes and businesses in the area with these ringers.^[@oneil_amazing_1963.]  According to a story he often told later in life, Gernsback received special permission from Pope Leo XIII at thirteen years old to enter the Carmelite convent of Luxembourg City to install a series of electric call bells for the nuns there.^[@siegel_hugo_1988, 16.]

Though this story is partially verifiable through a certificate of thanks from the Convent found by the Luxembourgeois Centre National de Littérature, it's worth pointing out here that the portrait of Gernsback's life we are left with in the historical record consists largely of a series of self-propagated stories that border on braggadocio:  that a police officer intruded on the Electro Importing Company offices to interrogate them for fraud with the Telimco set in 1906, for "no wireless combination could be sold at this low price"; that Gernsback coined the term "television" in his December 1909 editorial **Television and the Telephot** (he didn't); that his recommendations were incorporated "word for word" into the Radio Act of 1912 (one recommendation was, the wording wasn't---see **The Alexander Wireless Bill** and *Wireless and the Amateur**).  Once influential science fiction historian and Gernsback's friend Sam Moskowitz recorded these stories in his many biographical profiles of Gernsback, they became established as a kind of ritualistically repeated gospel truth, with Moskowitz playing the apostle to Gernsback's prophecies.  Evidence contrary to or even in excess of the received doxa is hard to come by, with many press and literary critical accounts barely rephrasing Moskowitz's prose.^[Beginning with @moskowitz_hugo_1959.]

We do know that despite the precociousness of his youth, Gernsback was by most measures a terrible student, falling at the bottom of his class at an industrial school near home from the ages of twelve to fifteen.  When he left to attend the Technikum in Bingen, Germany (now the Fachhochschule Bingen) from seventeen to eighteen, he regularly skipped classes and received poor grades in all subjects save electricity and physics.  It was during these teenage years that Gernsback acquired a penchant for gambling with the money he earned doing various electrical jobs in poker games, though his tendency to be cleaned out by older players seemed to keep him from falling too deep into this habit.^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 15.]  Outside of school, Gernsback was drawn to American culture from an early age.  He was a fan of John Philip Sousa's military marches and even composed his own patriotic Luxembourgish piece in the style of Sousa titled *Rǒd, Wêis, Blo* that was performed by the Military Band at the Place d'Armes in Luxembourg into the 1930s.^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 15-16.]  He was a devoted reader of cowboy stories and was such a fan of Mark Twain that he wrote a now-lost novel of his own at seventeen, *Der Pechvogel,* under the name Huck Gernsbacher.  But it was stories of the otherworldly that truly fired his imagination.  Reading the astronomer Percival Lowell's book *Mars* at the age of nine, with its fusion of the hard sciences and speculation about alien life, served as Gernsback's introduction to the literature he would later come to think of as a distinct genre of scientifiction.  He dove headfirst into the stories of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, claiming to have nearly memorized many of their novels while still very young.^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 229.]

Despite his predilection for journeys into unknown frontiers, whether the American West or Martian canals, Gernsback remained tied to his home even after leaving, if not physically -- there is no proof he ever returned -- then through a meticulous self-fashioning.  Gernsback cultivated a distinctively (one might say distinctively unique) Luxembourgish identity throughout his life.  Though raised by German parents, he grew up in Luxembourg at a moment in which the tiny country's national identity was becoming more developed than ever before.  The anti-German sentiments of Gernsback's editorials and short fiction published during World War I (especially **The Magnetic Storm**) largely "reflect the attitude of a good part of the Luxembourgish people at the end of the Nineteenth century to demarcate between the two [Germany and Luxembourg] when faced with the more or less well marked pan-Germanic designs of Germany."^[@henzig_hugo_2010, 19.]  But the many identities attributed to Gernsback throughout his life -- he is described variously in the press as Prussian, German, Belgian, French, a "multilingual dandy" -- seemed to allow him a kind of ambiguity that he relished.

> In the era of tie-dye and sandals, Gernsback continued to dress like a visiting dignitary. For evenings on the town, he favored formal wear, including spats, an opera cape and an expensive silk homburg. He even affected a monocle, though he didn't really need it.^[@stashower_dreamer_1990.]

MORE on his style/affect -- LIFE article, Westfahl, Ashley, Coronet article from the 30s?

Despite the seeming seriousness of his demeanor, Sam Moskowitz testifies to Gernsback's sharp sense of humor:  "The truth is that Gernsback socially is a man of almost rapier-like wit, with a mischevious gleam in his eyes and with the rare ability to joke about his own misfortunes."^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 235.]

* * * * *

With the savings from his electrical installation work, Gernsback booked a first class ticket to the United States that was prohibitively expensive for most.  In February 1904, he arrived in New York by himself at the age of 19, in an ornate/elaborate three piece suit.  Perhaps inspired by his first experiences with that Leclanché cell as a boy, Gernsback carried with him the design for a new kind of dry cell battery whose electrolytic paste could replace the inefficient liquid of wet cells like the Leclanché.  Having been refused patents in both France and Germany for the battery, Gernsback decided to try his luck in the United States.  A year later, Gernsback began publishing on his ideas, with his first piece of writing appearing in print in *Scientific American* under that most American of names, "Huck" (**A New Interrupter**).  He was able to sell his battery technology to the Packard Motor Car Company, who ended up using the device in their ignition systems.  With the profits of his sale, Gernsback formed the Electro Importing Company, an importer of specialized electrical equipment from Europe and one of the first mail-order radio retailers in the country.  Through their catalog and retail store at 84 West Broadway, the company provided access to specialized wireless and electrical equipment not found anywhere outside of Europe.  Electro Importing catered to a diverse clientele, first manufacturing the Telimco in 1905 for their novice users, and providing their more advanced amateur experimenters with the first vacuum tube offered for sale to the general public in 1911.

After several issues of their mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, Electro Importing began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor. Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog evolved into a monthly magazine for the wireless homebrewer, *Modern Electrics* in 1908.  The transition from the mail-order catalog to the monthly magazine format was a smooth one, evidenced by the fact that the third edition (1908) of the Electro Importing catalog bears the title of the new full-format magazine, "Modern Electrics."  

The offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company, founded in 1915, published other how-to manuals, pamphlets, and complete books like *The Wireless Telephone,* *One Thousand and One Formulas,* and *The Wireless Course.*

While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, Germany, France, and in Gernsback's own company offices. Regular reporters like H. Winfield Secor and René Homer, celebrity guest contributors such as Lee De Forest, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla,^[Tesla first published his autobiography in serial installments in *Electrical Experimenter,* a book that was recently rereleased by Penguin Classics. @tesla_my_2011.] as well as the unnamed Paris Correspondent and Berlin Correspondent provided reports on television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

“Baran (2002) suggested that the inclusion of articles and features as well as the creation of plotlines are key features that distinguish magazines from catalogs.  It was in Modern Electrics in 1911 that Gernsback first began writing science fiction, using it for filler before finding demand for it from his readers.  Regular editorials such as those referred to below also give Modern Electrics stature as a magazine.” (268)

	The evolution of magazines out of catalogs, and the gradual distinction made between these two genres, a point made in S.J. Baran’s Introduction to Mass Communication: Media Literacy and Culture (2002).

But the hallmark of the magazine became its more speculative articles, those that were willing to extrapolate fantastic scenarios out of the technical details at hand. In "Signaling to Mars," Gernsback detailed the conditions that would have to obtain in order for Earth to send messages via wireless telegraph to the red planet.  The quantitative description of the transmitting apparatus in terms of its necessary output (70,000 kilowatts) and best time of year to signal (summer) only constitutes one aspect of this scenario.  Gernsback goes on to take into account the nature of Martian intelligence that would be necessary for such a communicative circuit to be completed:  "we can only hope that the Martians are further advanced than we and may signal back to us, using a method new to us and possibly long discarded by them, when thousands of years ago they stopped signaling to us, and gave us up, as we did not have intelligence enough to understand" (**Signaling to Mars).  Continuing in the tradition of Percival Lowell and William Henry Pickering---the latter of whom offered a similar proposal on the front page of *The New York Times* to communicate with Mars using a series of mirrors^[@_planned_1909]---the supposition of Martian technology (or biology, or ecology) provided a topos upon which readers might asses the direction of its terrestrial analogues.

For readers of *Modern Electrics*, the technical context in which this highly speculative article appeared only led credence to the idea that contact with an alien civilization was right around the corner. In the copy of this issue at Princeton University's Firestone Library, someone inserted a newspaper clipping (now a permanently affixed leaf within the bound volume) that tells of a new distance record for wireless signaling, from San Francisco to the Pacific Mail Line steamship Korea as it made its way across the ocean. Left there as if to vouch for the plausibility of the idea that we'll soon be able to connect with our nearest planetary neighbor, the clipping provides a wonderful sense of how it was people read these magazines.[^clp] Though the Gernsback titles eventually became infamous for their sometimes outlandish claims---that electric current might clean us better than water; that the success of a marriage can be predicted using gadgets assembled out of various household supplies---they were always presented through a lens of supposedly scientific rationality. This frame affected the reception of the magazines by their readers, the design ethos that grew up around them, and the kind of fiction they eventually produced.

[^clp]: While I haven't been able to determine the provenance of this particular article, other pieces reporting on the Korea's distance signaling record were published in the *New York Times*on November 8, 1909 and the *Boston Evening Transcript*, November 6, 1909.

![](images/signaling_mars_insert.jpg)

Gernsback sold *Modern Electrics* to sold to Orland Ridenour [WHO?? HG'S NEIGHBOR?] in 1913.  It continued on as Modern Electrics and Mechanics for two years before merging with Popular Science Monthly in April 1915, a magazine that continues to be published today.

With *Electrical Experimenter,* Gernsback added an illustrator to the staff who would provide depth and dimension to his visions for decades to come.  Frank R. Paul's background:  "Gernsback, seeking a cartoonist to put across salient points in articles, in 1914 began to utilize the pen of Frank R. Paul.  Then an editorial cartoonist for the *Jersey Journal,* Paul also had prior training as a mechanical and architectural draftsman.  From that time on Paul's highly imaginative yet mechanistically precise illustrations were to become the mark of a Gernsback technical or science fiction magazine." @moskowitz_explorers_1963, 234.

The shape of media to come took on an iconography all its own through the illustrations of Frank R. Paul. Paul's depictions of gadgetry circulated widely beyond their original publication venues in a way that has never before been given any attention. Plans for the osophone, a device Gernsback designed to replace headphones by transmitting sound through vibrations in the jawbone of the listener (**Hearing Through Your Teeth**), were published and reviewed in the German journal *Der Radio-Amateur.*^[@nesper_osophon_1924]  Paul's sketch of a man using a tuning fork to calibrate the speed of the 1928 *Science and Invention* Nipkow disk television receiver was republished the following year in the Chinese film journal *Yingxi zazhi* (*Shadow Play Magazine*) as an illustration of recent research into television, what was referred to in the article as, directly translated, "wireless cinema."^[@bao_sympathetic_2011. Bao located Paul's illustration of the *Science and Invention* television receiver in @shen_dianyingjie_1929. The term for television used in this article is "wuxian dianying (wireless cinema, or, more literally, wireless electric shadow, or radio shadow)." Paul's images were originally published in @gernsback_radio_1928.]  The articles themselves were translated widely into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, and Arabic.^[@_this_1919]

“science"

------------

“For interwar science ficiotn, ‘amazing,’ ‘astounding,’ and ‘wonder’ were more than magazine titles; they were also metaphors for a specific style to imagine science, clarion calls for its conversation.  … Gernsback developed a view of participatory science before he began his science fiction ventures…” @cheng_astounding_2012

“In the early years of pulp science fiction magazines in the 1920s and 1930s there are not many letters that discuss what science fictiron or scientifiction is.  Everyone knew what ‘it’ was — it had something to do with ‘science’ — but everyone seemed to have a different notion of what constituted ‘science,’ what does and does not belong to the universe of science fiction and who has the rights to make these decisions.  What science fiction is, the genre, is taken for granted in the letters, but the texts, the instances of this genre, are not so defined, so that attempts to limit the field become a series of test cases about which there is not always agreement.” @larbalestier_battle_2002, 33

See Larbalestier section, “the science in science fiction,” 31-38

See 192008 “Science and Invention” on G’s definition of science as what the average person understands, not the expert.

american science education context

-----------------------------------------------

I was on the move yesterday. Two articles by John Rudolph (at Madison) — Epistemology for the Masses and something on general science in Chicago — will be useful. Jewett's book on science and democracy would also be good to cite. And my own work will in fact deal with this, but mostly with the c19 preconditions that led to this kind of c20 rhetoric. Is that useful? Hope all's well..

See 192310 “The New Science and Invention” on how he sees the magazine’s role in popular science

"The reason is that the average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of text of scientific facts, which means concentration and study. With fiction, however, this does not hold true because fiction is an entertainment; it does not require study. On the other hand, *we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study.*"

"prophet"

---------------

He's flattened out as a number of astoundingly early dates and predictions (in vitro fertilization, the transistor radio, atomic war, and education by television).  Arthur C. Clarke dedicated *Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible* "to Hugo Gernsback, who thought of everything."

These ideas were of course all "in the air," but Gernsback had a knack for tuning into them, and re-presenting them in digestible, shiny, attractive form.  (USE HG NEWSROOM CARTOON).  Texts that are in a way authorless: because HG was the house name for other editors who worked for him (see Larbaliestier); because he circulated stories about himself constantly; because those stories have largely been picked up as shorthand in SF studies when they care to mention HG as the gospel truth.  

But this flattens out the special way in which his writings tied material interaction and tinkering to a critical understanding of the future, rather than just a simple prognostication of it.  He organized a community that together built the future.  So, in writing about him, we have to be careful to cut through the stories he told about himself, the self-image he crafted.

On a new form of scientific education:  “This was certainly a far cry from the genteel instruction on natural philosophy to promote polite drawing room conversation on scientific theory published just a few decades earlier.  It’s interesting to consider just what a young Michael Faraday would make of such a book or of Harper’s Electricity Book for Boys (1907)” Schlesinger, Battery book. @experimentation

on amateur experimenter culture, boys hoping to get rich

	Parents eager to set their children on the right path bought them chemistry sets with names like Chemcraft, produced by the Porter Chemical Company, which also sponsored Chemists Clubs.  Young adult books on electricity and technology flourished, many of them written for boys and intended to instill the noble desire to invent.  Who knew when the next Edison or Morse might arrive on the scene to offer up the world a truly wonderful practical miracle?” (Schlesinger, loc 2808)

“His publishing endeavors after that date [when he lost control of Wonder Stories in 1936] had far less influence on the field, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s he delegated the editorial work on these magazines to T. O’Conor Sloane, C.A. Brandt, and Wilbur C. Whitehead (Clute and Nicholls 1993: 490-91; Tymn and Ashley 1985: 14-57).  This means that Gernsback did not necessarily write all or even the majority of the editorial comments during the periods in which he was the publisher and editor of such magazines as Amazing Stories and Wonder Stories.  However, such is the mythic force of Gernsback, the founding father, that in the majority of the work I have read on this period he is spoken of as though he wrote every word of editorial comment in the magazines he published.  ‘Gernsback’ has come to operate as synonymous with the magazines he founded, whether he was actively contributing to them or not.  I will continue this practice, allowing ‘Gernsback’ to stand for the house editorial voice.”  An important point to emphasize here, that Gernsback is more or less the magazines.  A collection of “his” writings is a collection of the voice that stood in for the conversation of this growing community, this growing discourse on media, technology, and the future.  

Hugo and Sidney were paying themselves over $1,000 per week. (114)  In contrast, as the editor of Amazing, Gernsback only paid Lovecraft $25 for his classic “The Colour Out of Space.”  About 1/5 of a cent per word.  From there, Lovecraft gives him the nickname “Hugo the rat.”  a racial tinge here?  Massie and Perry article.

Lewis Mumford article in first intallment issue of Ralph in Modern Electrics.  Mumford writes in his autobiography: "in my youth, as a zelous reader of Hugo Gernsback's Modern Electrics, I shared my generation's pious belief in our future."  Mumford's first publication was at the age of 15, an eight line article on 'new breakthroughs in radio receivers' published in Modern Electrics.  Article in first Ralph issue was "A Portable Receiving Outfit."  (from Westfahl HG and the Century, p. 62). 

other later famous authors: "Neither Gernsback's instinct for the unorthodox, however, nor his unabashed sense of the ate has prevented his full acceptance as a member of the scientific community.  Dozens of today's top scientists were attracted to their calling by reading his magazines as boys, and a good many--including Dr. Donald H. Menzel, director of the Harvard Observatory--earned money for college by writing for them." (From LIFE Magazine profile).  "The greatest inventors and scientists of the early 20th Century--among them Marconi, Edison, Tesla, Goddard, De Forest and Oberth--correspond freely with him and came, in many cases, to admire and confide in him as well." 

Unlike their mid-nineteenth-century predecessors, such as Harpers and The Atlantic, which were funded largely through subscription, twentieth-century magazines such as Gernsback’s made most their [sic] money from advertising (Wilson 45).  Because of their need to sell advertisements for products and services, these new magazines gave the impression that an active healthy middle-class life depended on possessing proper knowledge, personality, physique, and equipment, all of which could be purchased from solicitors listed on the index to advertisers page.  Readers could learn special skills like knitting from magazines such as Modern Priscilla, how to run a modern business properly from The Magazine of Business, or how to wire a crystal wireless receiver from Gernsback’s Modern Electrics.” (Drown 57)  

Massie and Perry:  “The magazine averaged around 150 pages of content per issue in 1923 with the largest issue coming in December with almost 300 advertisers and 190 pages.  But by summer 1927, advertising levels were somewhat less at around 120 companies buying space in just fewer than 100 of the magazine’s pages.  In December of that year, the Christmas season brought that number up to only around 170 for a 143-page issue.  The declining trend continued.  In June 1928, advertisers numbered only in the 80s.” (274)  most likely a matter of rise of broadcasting, and fall of experimenter, point-to-point radios 

Perry: With his new company, Gernsback has an analog for each of his publications.  Readers of Science and Invention move to Everyday Mechanics.  Radio News readers can move on to Radio-Craft.  and Amazing Stories readers can migrate to Science Wonder Stories, illegally sending out advertisements to the subscription lists of the old magazines after they had already been seized by the bankruptcy court and bought by the Irving Trust Company, its assets reogranized and sold to B.A. MacKinnon, while [Bernarr] Macfadden Publications bid, as well as William Randolph Hearst[!!].  MacKinnon after depression financial difficulties sold the magazine to Macfadden, who took over and did all the Popular Mechanics merging.  Sold to Ziff-Davis in 1938.  If they were charged with diverting assets, the penalty is 5 yrs in prison.
