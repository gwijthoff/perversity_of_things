Born Hugo Gernsbacher in Luxembourg in 1884, the son of a wealthy wine merchant, Gernsback was educated at the École Industrielle of Luxembourg and the Technikum in Bingen, Germany.  His passion for technology began early, with a handyman employed by his father teaching the six-year-old Gernsback how to use a Leclanché cell battery, and at thirteen “received special dispensation from Pope Leo XIII so that he could install electric call bells in the Carmelite convent of Luxembourg City.”^[@siegel_hugo_1988, p. 16]

Gernsback's passion for electrical technologies began early.  But growing up off the grid in the town of Hollerich, which wasn't yet connected to Luxembourg City's electricity network, so 

one of his father's employees, Jean-Pierre Görgen

cultivated a distinctively Luxembourgish identity throughout his life.  Sam Moskowitz, Gernsback's friend and chronicler, testifies to Gernsback's sharp sense of humor.  "His almost Prussian bearing, his sharp features, his habit of using a monocle when he reads restaurant menus, coupled with his serious scientific interests, have given many people a misleading impression.  The truth is that Gernsback socially is a man of almost rapier-like wit, with a mischevious gleam in his eyes and with the rare ability to joke about his own misfortunes."^[@moskowitz_explorers_1963, 235.]

> In the era of tie-dye and sandals, Gernsback continued to dress like a visiting dignitary. For evenings on the town, he favored formal wear, including spats, an opera cape and an expensive silk homburg. He even affected a monocle, though he didn't really need it. When dining out, he would refuse to eat unless his plates were warmed to the proper temperature. He considered himself a wine connoisseur and once sent back three bottles in a single sitting.^[@stashower_dreamer_1990.]

Ah, that monocle.

by all accounts a terrible student, rarely attending classes at and barely receiving passing grades at 

regularly at the bottom of his class at the École Industrielle of Luxembourg from the age of 12 to 15, and later at the Technikum in Bingen, Germany from 17 to 18, "According to his scorecards he was not a very regularly present, nor was he very diligent.  In the majority ofsubjects, with the exception of electricity and physics, his results were rather bad.  

an interest in American culture: a fan of John Philip Sousa's military marches (Gernsback composed his own march, a patriotic Luxembourgish march titled *Rǒd, Wêis, Blo* that was played by the Military Band at the Place d'Armes in Luxembourg through the 1930s. (15-16)

"As the area in which Hugo Gernsback lived at the time [Hollerich] was not yet linked to the electricity network of Luxembourg City he developed at the end of the 19th century his own batteries for the needs of his family and neighbours." (an amazing story 50)

third child to German parents Moritz Gernsbacher and Bertha Dürlacher, former who was a wine wholesaler from Bühl, Baden-Baden, who later immigrated to Luxembourg.

gambled often in Luxembourg which "ended, however, as soon as he read Mars by the American astronomer, Percival Lowell" 

Gernsback immigrated to the United States in 1904 at the age of 19, carrying with him the design for a new kind of dry cell battery, perhaps inspired by his first experiences with that Leclanché cell---which used a liquid or "wet" electrolyte as opposed to a "dry" paste.  

Gernsback published his first article piece of writing a year later in *Scientific American* under that most American of names, "Huck,” profiling his design for the new device.  Gernsback sold the battery patent to the Packard Motor Car Company, who ended up using technology in their ignition systems.  With the profits of his sale, Gernsback formed the Electro Importing Company, an importer of specialized electrical equipment from Europe and the first mail-order radio house in the country [MOSKOWITZ'S WORDS]. Through their catalog and retail store at 84 West Broadway in New York, the company provided access to specialized wireless and electrical equipment not found anywhere outside of Europe. Electro Importing catered to a diverse clientele, providing their more advanced basement experimenters with the first vacuum tube offered for sale to the general public in 1911, and manufacturing for their novice users in 1905 the first ever fully assembled radio set commercially available in the United States, the Telimco.

![Electro Importing Company store, c. 1908.](images/eico_store.png)

After several issues of their mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, Electro Importing began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor. Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog grew into a series of monthly magazines for the wireless homebrewer, beginning with *Modern Electrics* in 1908 and the offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company in 1915. While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, Germany, France, and in Gernsback's own company offices. Regular reporters and celebrity guest contributors like Lee De Forest, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla.^[Tesla first published his autobiography in serial installments in *Electrical Experimenter,* a book that was recently rereleased by Penguin Classics. @tesla_my_2011] provided reports on television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

Frank R. Paul's background:  "Gernsback, seeking a cartoonist to put across salient points in articles, in 1914 began to utilize the pen of Frank R. Paul.  Then an editorial cartoonist for the *Jersey Journal,* Paul also had prior training as a mechanical and architectural draftsman.  From that time on Paul's highly imaginative yet mechanistically precise illustrations were to become the mark of a Gernsback technical or science fiction magazine." @moskowitz_explorers_1963, 234.

* * * * * * * * 

All of this began with the *Electro Importing Catalog.*  Gernsback's *Modern Electrics* began as a mail-order catalogue for imported wireless parts and exotic electrical miscellany in 1905.  After several issues of the mail order catalog and a growing subscription list, *Electro Importing* began including features, editorials, and letters to the editor.  Between 1906 and 1910, the catalog grew into a series of monthly magazines for the wireless homebrewer, beginning with *Modern Electrics* in 1908 and the offshoot Experimenter Publishing Company in 1915, later expanding to a fleet of popular and specialist magazines like *Electrical Experimenter, Radio News, Science & Invention*, and the *Technocracy Review*.  The transition from the mail-order catalog to the "slick paper" monthly magazine format was a smooth one, evidenced by the fact that the third edition (1908) of the Electro Importing catalog bears the title of the new full-format magazine, "Modern Electrics."  

While *Modern Electrics* still advertised the equipment Electro Importing offered for sale in a familiar grid layout with ordering instructions, it also included feature articles detailing the latest research into experimental media technologies in America, Germany, France, and in Gernsback's own company offices.  Regular reporters like H. Winfield Secor and René Homer, celebrity guest contributors such as Lee De Forest, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla, as well as the unnamed Paris Correspondent and Berlin Correspondent provided reports on television, wireless telephony, and the use of novel electrical apparatuses in film and theatrical productions, each of which would go into a great degree of technical detail.

“Baran (2002) suggested that the inclusion of articles and features as well as the creation of plotlines are key features that distinguish magazines from catalogs.  It was in Modern Electrics in 1911 that Gernsback first began writing science fiction, using it for filler before finding demand for it from his readers.  Regular editorials such as those referred to below also give Modern Electrics stature as a magazine.” (268)

	The evolution of magazines out of catalogs, and the gradual distinction made between these two genres, a point made in S.J. Baran’s Introduction to Mass Communication: Media Literacy and Culture (2002).

![Modern Electrics in its original catalog form, 1908.](images/me_catalog1908.jpg)

But the hallmark of the magazine became its more speculative articles, those that were willing to extrapolate fantastic scenarios out of the technical details at hand. In "Signaling to Mars," Gernsback detailed the conditions that would have to obtain in order for Earth to send messages via wireless telegraph to the red planet.  The quantitative description of the transmitting apparatus in terms of its necessary output (70,000 kilowatts) and best time of year to signal (summer) only constitutes one aspect of this scenario.  Gernsback goes on to take into account the nature of Martian intelligence that would be necessary for such a communicative circuit to be completed:  "we can only hope that the Martians are further advanced than we and may signal back to us, using a method new to us and possibly long discarded by them, when thousands of years ago they stopped signaling to us, and gave us up, as we did not have intelligence enough to understand."^[@gernsback_signaling_1909]  Continuing in the tradition of Percival Lowell and William Henry Pickering---the latter of whom offered a similar proposal on the front page of *The New York Times* to communicate with Mars using a series of mirrors^[@_planned_1909]---the supposition of Martian technology (or biology, or ecology) provided a topos upon which readers might asses the direction of its terrestrial analogues.

For readers of *Modern Electrics*, the technical context in which this highly speculative article appeared only led credence to the idea that contact with an alien civilization was right around the corner. In the copy of this issue at Princeton University's Firestone Library, someone inserted a newspaper clipping (now a permanently affixed leaf within the bound volume) that tells of a new distance record for wireless signaling, from San Francisco to the Pacific Mail Line steamship Korea as it made its way across the ocean. Left there as if to vouch for the plausibility of the idea that we'll soon be able to connect with our nearest planetary neighbor, the clipping provides a wonderful sense of how it was people read these magazines.[^clp] Though the Gernsback titles eventually became infamous for their sometimes outlandish claims – that electric current might clean us better than water; that the success of a marriage can be predicted using gadgets assembled out of various household supplies – they were always presented through a lens of supposedly scientific rationality. This frame affected the reception of the magazines by their readers, the design ethos that grew up around them, and the kind of fiction they eventually produced.

[^clp]: While I haven't been able to determine the provenance of this particular article, other pieces reporting on the Korea's distance signaling record were published in the *New York Times*on November 8, 1909 and the *Boston Evening Transcript*, November 6, 1909.

The shape of media to come took on an iconography all its own through the illustrations of Frank R. Paul. Paul's depictions of gadgetry circulated widely beyond their original publication venues in a way that has never before been given any attention. Plans for the osophon, a device Gernsback designed to replace headphones by transmitting sound through vibrations in the jawbone of the listener, were published and reviewed in the German journal *Der Radio-Amateur*.^[@nesper_osophon_1924]  Paul's sketch of a man using a tuning fork to calibrate the speed of the 1928 *Science and Invention* Nipkow disk television receiver was republished the following year in the Chinese film journal *Yingxi zazhi* (*Shadow Play Magazine*) as an illustration of recent research into television, what was referred to in the article as, directly translated, "wireless cinema."^[@bao_sympathetic_2011. Bao located Paul's illustration of the *Science and Invention* television receiver in @shen_dianyingjie_1929. The term for television used in this article is "wuxian dianying (wireless cinema, or, more literally, wireless electric shadow, or radio shadow)." Paul's images were originally published in @gernsback_radio_1928.]  Paul's images, now in the public domain, accompanied Gernsback's writings and will form an important part of this collection as well.

The incredibly rich context of the science fiction's birth in Gernsback's fleet of technical publications for the amateur experimenter, as well as his work as a pioneer in media technologies and broadcasting techniques, have been entirely overlooked.  In his illustrated magazines and compendiums of amateur designs, one could find a literary treatise on what the genre of "scientifiction" should look like alongside blueprints for a homebrewed television receiver well before its commercial possibility.  Gernsback's translation of an influential German handbook titled *The Practical Electrician* ran next to a speculative article on what it would take to provide a global system of free electricity powered by ocean currents.  Long before Gernsback founded *Amazing Stories,* these magazines used speculative fiction to find a language suited to the analysis of emerging media like radio, television, or the more exotic osophone and telegraphone.

*The Perversity of Things* thus seeks to provide a reappraisal of both the "hard" technical roots of American science fiction and the highly speculative orientation toward media technologies during this period.  Science fiction in its early days wasn't just a literary form, it was a mode of interacting with new media.  The literary historical gambit of this book is to recover the radical sense of openness that greeted not only the basement tinkerer working through the feasibility of transmitting images over a wire, but also the author of "scientifiction" stories who possessed a highly sophisticated awareness of the fact that "Two hundred years ago, stories of this kind were not possible."  Often, these individuals were one and the same, weaving together functional and fictional devices in a manner that served for them as a form of scientific discovery in itself.

## Gernsback's reputation in the critical literature

Hugo Gernsback has been given very little attention in science fiction studies, with the field's leading critics often assuming that *Amazing Stories* was little more than a marketing gimmick for Gernsback's technical ventures.  The fiction published in the pages of his magazines is often seen to have very little aesthetic or literary value.  So when Gernsback is given credit in the foundation of modern American SF, it is as a kind of marketer of a new brand name, rather than a writer or editor.  As Alexi and Cory Panshin write, "In the pages of *Amazing*, SF literature at last became identified by a single name: 'scientifiction.' It was provided with a history. It was defined and demonstrated. It was consolidated and unified. In *Amazing*, SF became conscious of itself."^[@panshin_world_1989, 170.]  According to John Clute and Peter Nicholls, Gernsback "gave the genre a local habitation and a name," and for James Gunn, he "provided a focus for enthusiasm, for publication, for development," and bestowed science fiction with its "characteristic content, a characteristic form, and characteristic purposes."^[@clute_encyclopedia_1995, 491. @gunn_alternate_1975, 128.] 

These critical histories (each of which are written by SF novelists in their own right) proceed as if propelled by their own fantastic, alternate history: what if science fiction left us with texts as highly valued as the works of modernism from the very beginning? No doubt the field of science fiction studies has done a great deal of work in order to elevate certain works of the genre (mainly from the 1960s and 70s New Wave) to a kind of academic respectability. But these assumptions about the genre's magazine era beginnings have never been questioned, nor have any of Gernsback's publications save for *Amazing Stories* been submitted to any kind of rigorous analysis. The editorial function many SF histories begrudgingly ascribe to Gernsback overlooks the much more interesting heritage of magazine SF within a wider tradition of thinking about new media.

# Recent attention

This story has held sway over the reception of Gernsback until very recently. But the need for this volume is now becoming apparent as we experience technological revolutions in the fabric of the everyday similar to those that brought readers to the Gernsback publications a century ago.  The ability of Gernsback's ideas to speak to us today can be seen in the ways that images from his magazines circulate online through a wide variety of social image sharing sites and blogs, like Reddit, Tumblr, and the Scientific American blog *Paleofuture*. Gernsback's life and works are now beginning to receive a more formal treatment as well, with two major museum exhibits recently held: one at Luxembourg's [National Center for Literature](http://www.cnl.public.lu/agenda/2011/5/Expo_Hugo_Gernsback/index.html?highlight=gernsback) in 2011, and another in 2013 at the [ZKM (Center for Art and Media Technology)](http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader8492) in Karlsruhe, curated by Franz Pichler and the media theorist Peter Weibel.^[A video of this exhibit can be seen at <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEq6Mlu9j8I>.]  In addition, the visual artist Eric Schockmel is currently developing an animated documentary film about Gernsback.

“science"

------------

“For interwar science ficiotn, ‘amazing,’ ‘astounding,’ and ‘wonder’ were more than magazine titles; they were also metaphors for a specific style to imagine science, clarion calls for its conversation.  … Gernsback developed a view of participatory science before he began his science fiction ventures…” @cheng_astounding_2012

“In the early years of pulp science fiction magazines in the 1920s and 1930s there are not many letters that discuss what science fictiron or scientifiction is.  Everyone knew what ‘it’ was — it had something to do with ‘science’ — but everyone seemed to have a different notion of what constituted ‘science,’ what does and does not belong to the universe of science fiction and who has the rights to make these decisions.  What science fiction is, the genre, is taken for granted in the letters, but the texts, the instances of this genre, are not so defined, so that attempts to limit the field become a series of test cases about which there is not always agreement.” @larbalestier_battle_2002, 33

See Larbalestier section, “the science in science fiction,” 31-38

See 192008 “Science and Invention” on G’s definition of science as what the average person understands, not the expert.

american science education context

-----------------------------------------------

I was on the move yesterday. Two articles by John Rudolph (at Madison) — Epistemology for the Masses and something on general science in Chicago — will be useful. Jewett's book on science and democracy would also be good to cite. And my own work will in fact deal with this, but mostly with the c19 preconditions that led to this kind of c20 rhetoric. Is that useful? Hope all's well..

See 192310 “The New Science and Invention” on how he sees the magazine’s role in popular science

"The reason is that the average man or woman does not wish to laboriously wander through miles of text of scientific facts, which means concentration and study. With fiction, however, this does not hold true because fiction is an entertainment; it does not require study. On the other hand, *we have tried to reduce all scientific matter to entertainment instead of study.*"

incredulity

---------------

Like magic shows, stories circulate about people's incredulity at the device, stories almost certainly propagated by Gernsback himself:  "A politician well-schooled in fraud, New York's Mayor Gaynor, sent a policeman to Gernsback's office at 32 Park Place to arrest him.  However, New York's finest was forced to retreat empty-handed---though probably still skeptical---after Gernsback demonstrated the machine's operation between the hall and the bedroom."^[@siegel_hugo_1988, p. 18-19]

Gernsback only exists anymore as a series of stories that followed him around, stories he almost certainly propagated himself and that were later recorded by Sam Moskowitz.  That a police officer showed up to the offices of Electro Importing investigating them for fraud with the Telimco; that he coined the term "television" in his December 1909 editorial (he didn't; see footnotes); that his recommendations were incorporated "word for word" into the Radio Act of 1912 (the recommended wavelength of 200 meters was, the wording wasn't---see **The Alexander Wireless Bill** and *Wireless and the Amateur**).  He's flattened out as a number of astoundingly early dates and predictions (in vitro fertilization, the transistor radio, atomic war, and education by television).  Arthur C. Clarke dedicated *Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry Into the Limits of the Possible* "to Hugo Gernsback, who thought of everything."

These ideas were of course all "in the air," but Gernsback had a knack for tuning into them, and re-presenting them in digestible, shiny, attractive form.  (USE HG NEWSROOM CARTOON).  Texts that are in a way authorless: because HG was the house name for other editors who worked for him (see Larbaliestier); because he circulated stories about himself constantly; because those stories have largely been picked up as shorthand in SF studies when they care to mention HG as the gospel truth.  

But this flattens out the special way in which his writings tied material interaction and tinkering to a critical understanding of the future, rather than just a simple prognostication of it.  He organized a community that together built the future.  So, in writing about him, we have to be careful to cut through the stories he told about himself, the self-image he crafted.

On a new form of scientific education:  “This was certainly a far cry from the genteel instruction on natural philosophy to promote polite drawing room conversation on scientific theory published just a few decades earlier.  It’s interesting to consider just what a young Michael Faraday would make of such a book or of Harper’s Electricity Book for Boys (1907)” Schlesinger, Battery book. @experimentation

on amateur experimenter culture, boys hoping to get rich

	Parents eager to set their children on the right path bought them chemistry sets with names like Chemcraft, produced by the Porter Chemical Company, which also sponsored Chemists Clubs.  Young adult books on electricity and technology flourished, many of them written for boys and intended to instill the noble desire to invent.  Who knew when the next Edison or Morse might arrive on the scene to offer up the world a truly wonderful practical miracle?” (Schlesinger, loc 2808)

“His publishing endeavors after that date [when he lost control of Wonder Stories in 1936] had far less influence on the field, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s he delegated the editorial work on these magazines to T. O’Conor Sloane, C.A. Brandt, and Wilbur C. Whitehead (Clute and Nicholls 1993: 490-91; Tymn and Ashley 1985: 14-57).  This means that Gernsback did not necessarily write all or even the majority of the editorial comments during the periods in which he was the publisher and editor of such magazines as Amazing Stories and Wonder Stories.  However, such is the mythic force of Gernsback, the founding father, that in the majority of the work I have read on this period he is spoken of as though he wrote every word of editorial comment in the magazines he published.  ‘Gernsback’ has come to operate as synonymous with the magazines he founded, whether he was actively contributing to them or not.  I will continue this practice, allowing ‘Gernsback’ to stand for the house editorial voice.”  An important point to emphasize here, that Gernsback is more or less the magazines.  A collection of “his” writings is a collection of the voice that stood in for the conversation of this growing community, this growing discourse on media, technology, and the future.  

Hugo and Sidney were paying themselves over $1,000 per week. (114)  In contrast, as the editor of Amazing, Gernsback only paid Lovecraft $25 for his classic “The Colour Out of Space.”  About 1/5 of a cent per word.  From there, Lovecraft gives him the nickname “Hugo the rat.”  a racial tinge here?  Massie and Perry article.

Lewis Mumford article in first intallment issue of Ralph in Modern Electrics.  Mumford writes in his autobiography: "in my youth, as a zelous reader of Hugo Gernsback's Modern Electrics, I shared my generation's pious belief in our future."  Mumford's first publication was at the age of 15, an eight line article on 'new breakthroughs in radio receivers' published in Modern Electrics.  Article in first Ralph issue was "A Portable Receiving Outfit."  (from Westfahl HG and the Century, p. 62). 

other later famous authors: "Neither Gernsback's instinct for the unorthodox, however, nor his unabashed sense of the ate has prevented his full acceptance as a member of the scientific community.  Dozens of today's top scientists were attracted to their calling by reading his magazines as boys, and a good many--including Dr. Donald H. Menzel, director of the Harvard Observatory--earned money for college by writing for them." (From LIFE Magazine profile).  "The greatest inventors and scientists of the early 20th Century--among them Marconi, Edison, Tesla, Goddard, De Forest and Oberth--correspond freely with him and came, in many cases, to admire and confide in him as well." 

Unlike their mid-nineteenth-century predecessors, such as Harpers and The Atlantic, which were funded largely through subscription, twentieth-century magazines such as Gernsback’s made most their [sic] money from advertising (Wilson 45).  Because of their need to sell advertisements for products and services, these new magazines gave the impression that an active healthy middle-class life depended on possessing proper knowledge, personality, physique, and equipment, all of which could be purchased from solicitors listed on the index to advertisers page.  Readers could learn special skills like knitting from magazines such as Modern Priscilla, how to run a modern business properly from The Magazine of Business, or how to wire a crystal wireless receiver from Gernsback’s Modern Electrics.” (Drown 57)  

Massie and Perry:  “The magazine averaged around 150 pages of content per issue in 1923 with the largest issue coming in December with almost 300 advertisers and 190 pages.  But by summer 1927, advertising levels were somewhat less at around 120 companies buying space in just fewer than 100 of the magazine’s pages.  In December of that year, the Christmas season brought that number up to only around 170 for a 143-page issue.  The declining trend continued.  In June 1928, advertisers numbered only in the 80s.” (274)  most likely a matter of rise of broadcasting, and fall of experimenter, point-to-point radios 

Perry: With his new company, Gernsback has an analog for each of his publications.  Readers of Science and Invention move to Everyday Mechanics.  Radio News readers can move on to Radio-Craft.  and Amazing Stories readers can migrate to Science Wonder Stories, illegally sending out advertisements to the subscription lists of the old magazines after they had already been seized by the bankruptcy court and bought by the Irving Trust Company, its assets reogranized and sold to B.A. MacKinnon, while [Bernarr] Macfadden Publications bid, as well as William Randolph Hearst[!!].  MacKinnon after depression financial difficulties sold the magazine to Macfadden, who took over and did all the Popular Mechanics merging.  Sold to Ziff-Davis in 1938.  If they were charged with diverting assets, the penalty is 5 yrs in prison.
