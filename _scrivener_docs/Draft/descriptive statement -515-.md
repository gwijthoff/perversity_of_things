*The Perversity of Things: Writings on Media, Tinkering, and Scientifiction* makes available texts by Gernsback that were foundational for both science fiction and the emergence of media studies.  This collection includes editorials, blueprints, literary critical essays, media histories, and short fiction that have been out of print since their original appearance between 1905 and 1933.  Together, they show how Gernsback's publications evolved from an electrical parts catalog into a fully-fledged literary genre.  Not only was Gernsback an active inventor and advocate for the rights of the amateur experimenter, he developed a means of describing and assessing the cultural impact of new media long before it was an academic discipline.

Though the Hugo Award is given out each year to the best works in the genre, he now receives little more than a one- to two-sentence nod in science fiction studies.  He is associated with the gaudy covers of his magazines, adorned with bug-eyed monsters and ray guns, and a "crude and heavy-handed" editorial style that perpetuated many of the negative stereotypes still associated with science fiction today.  Much of this attitude has been inherited from a generation of science fiction scholars who were themselves authors or editors, and disparaged Gernsback's editorial practices as well as the infamously low wages he paid his writers.
