Gernsback defends the title Amazing Stories over “Scientifiction,” because it might frighten off people who would otherwise be interested in the type of fiction offered.  The title is “the best one to influence the masses, because anything that smacks of science seems to be too ‘deep’ for the average type of reader.”  This title important not only to attract “the masses,” but women as well, who Gernsback is happy to report are reading the magazine. 

> A totally unforeseen result of the name, strange to say, was that a great many women are already reading the new magazine.  This is most encouraging. We know that they must have picked up AMAZING STORIES out of curiosity more than anything else, and found it to their liking, and we are certain that if the name of the magazine had been "Scientifiction," they would not have been attracted to it at a newsstand.  (**Editorially Speaking**)

A similar debate over the identity and construction of scientifiction broke out among readers when *Science Wonder Stories* simplified its name to *Wonder Stories* in June 1930.  And just as it does here, the conversation insidiously conflated genre and gender.  John Cheng writes, 

> readers' responses were swift, heated, and divided.  Those readers interested in science fiction's science were appalled.  'Your aim, I take it, is to make the title more "catchy,"' wrote Lloyd E. Foltz of Indianapolis, Indiana, 'to that class of magazine addicts who are already reading, "Sappy Stories," "Slushy Romances," and so on, ad nauseam.'  He argued that the changes betrayed science fiction's premise.  'I believe this is a mistake,' he said.  'It will attract a type of reader to whom S. A. means sex appeal and not scientific adventure.'  Other readers disagreed.  'Now for the burden that some of the readers seem to carry---romance,' wrote Darrel Richards, 8620 Hamilton Avenue, Detroit Michigan.  'Why shouldn't "females" … be included in the science fiction stories?' he asked.  'Remember, "Love makes the world go around."'

Justine Larbalestier points out that in many conversations on genre among readers, "the terms 'love interest,' 'romance,' 'sex,' and 'women' are used interchageably.  They become one and the same.  On the whole this equivalence between 'women' and 'love interest' disqualifies women from the field of science fiction, since love belongs to the field of romance" (10).  An argument for minimizing the presence of romance elements in the scientifiction genre thus becomes---in some cases explicitly---about marginalizing women.  For an account of a late 1930s debate among readers of *Astounding Science Fiction* that typifies this equivalency between genre and gender, (including an eighteen-year-old Isaac Asmiov who writes, "When we want science-fiction, we don't want swooning dames, and that goes double. … Come on, men, make yourself heard in favor of less love mixed with our science!"), see @larbalestier_battle_2002, 117-135.

One reader, Mary Byers of Springfield, OH, in a response to Asimov that Larbalestier argues echoes later feminist science fiction critics like Joanna Russ, writes:  "To his plea for less hooey I give my whole-hearted support, but less hooey does not mean less women; it means a difference in the way they are introduced into the story and the part they play." @byers_other_1938.

The very structure of SF actually ended up giving women a way into an arena they were formerly excluded from.  

signals letters written by “the fair sex” in SF magazines

Andrew Ross:  dialects of alien species in “Gernsbackian fiction” “typically vilified in the most overtly racist ways.”  Women rarely made an appearance in pulp SF, unlike Weird Tales’s vampires, witches, and high priestesses.  Frank Paul could draw men, machines, and monsters, “but was said to be technically deficient when it came to depicting female bodies” [IS THIS quote about Paul's deficiencies directly from Ross, or elsewhere?]
