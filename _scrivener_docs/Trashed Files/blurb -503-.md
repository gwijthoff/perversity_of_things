Though the Hugo Award is given out each year to the best works in the genre, he now receives little more than a one- to two-sentence nod in science fiction studies.  He is associated with the gaudy covers of his magazines, adorned with bug-eyed monsters and ray guns, and a "crude and heavy-handed" editorial style that perpetuated many of the negative stereotypes still associated with science fiction today.  Much of this attitude has been inherited from a generation of science fiction scholars who were themselves authors or editors, and disparaged Gernsback's editorial practices as well as the infamously low wages he paid his writers.
