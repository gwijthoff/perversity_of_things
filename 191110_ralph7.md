## Synopsis Of Preceding Installments

Ralph 124C 41+, living in New York in the year 2660, while in conversation with a friend at his Telephot, an Instrument enabling one to see at a distance, Is cut off from his friend and by mistake is connected with a young lady in Switzerland, thus making her acquaintance by Telephot.

The weather engineers in Switzerland who control the weather decided to strike against the Government and turned on the high depression of their Meteoro-Towers, therelry snowing in a large district. An avalanche threatens to sweep away tbe house In which the young Swiss lady, Miss 212B 423, lives and she appeals to the great American inventor, Ralph 124C 41+, to save her, which he promptly does by melting the avalanche by directed wireless energy from his New York laboratory.

The inventor on the same af ternoon is given an ovation by distance, in which the Telephot plays a great part. Afterwards he reads a "newspaper," the size of a postage stamp, and "writes" a lecture by means of the Menograph, an instrumeht by means of which words are made to appear on a paper tape by impulses from the brain acting on the apparatus. During the night his head Is connected electrically to the Hypnobioscope, lln Instrument by means of which words and sentences are transmitted directly to the brain while one sleeps, in such a manner that everything can be remembered the next morning.

The great Inventor, the next day, is visited by Mr. 212B 423 and his daughter from abroad. Both arrived by means of the Subatlantic Tube, piercing straight through the earth from New York to Brest IH France. In the af ternoon In presence of his guests and twenty professors from all over the globe, 124C 41+ brings life to a "radiumlzed" dog, who bad been killed three years previous in presence of the twenty professors. The dog had been preserved with the rare gas Permagatol and Radium-K bromide, which latter occupied the blood vessels of the dog for three years.

124C 41+ then proceeds to show Miss 212B 423 wonderful New York. Both put on "Tele· Motor-Coasters," propelled by wireless energy and roll about the town. They then visit the new electric restaurant ; the "Scientificafe," and enjoy a lunch of semi liquid food, supplied through tubes. Afterwards they see the monument of the last horse to die in harness in New York A. D. 2096.

Both then proceed in an aerocab to the National Playgrounds of New York City, located on Long Island where Montauk was formerly; they cover the distance in 10 minutes. They then play tennis and the charms of Miss 212B 423 keep 124c 41 spellbound. Finally when the young lady's wonderful long hair comes down by accident, 124C 41 takes a solemn oath that· he can never be happy without her. Both af terwards visit the Helio-Dynamophore plant which Is operated by the Sun's heat, transforming heat directly into electricity. This plant lights all New York and f urnishes Its power. In the evening 124C 41 entertains his guests in his Tele-Theater, i.e. theater by distance. '.!.'bey hear and see the new play "La Normande," playing at the "National Opera" four miles distant from 124C 41's house.

*T*HE entire party proceeded to roll down Broadway, the historic thoroughfare of New York. Despite the fact that it was 11 o'clock at night, the streets were almost as light as during the daytime. They were lighted up brilliantly by the Iridium spirals, hanging high above the street crossings. These light spirals emanated a pure, dazzling-white light of the same quality as sunlight. This light moreover was absolutely cold, as all electrical energy· was transformed into light, none being lost in useless heat. There was no darkness in any street, not even in the smallest alley.

Mr. 212B 423, as well as his daughter, admired the superb displays in the various stores and they entered several to acquire some souvenirs. Miss 212B 423 was much impressed with the automatic-electric packing machines. The clerk making the sale would place the purchased articles on a metal platform. He· then pushed several buttons on a small switchboard, which operated the "size" apparatus to obtain the dimensions of the package. Immediately after the last button was pressed, the platform would rise up about two feet, till it disappeared into a large metal, box-like contrivance. In about ten to fifteen
seconds it would come down bearing on its surface a neat white box with a handle at the top, all in one piece. The box was not fastened with any strings or tape, but was folded in an ingenious manner so that it could not open of its own accord. Moreover, it was made of the extremely light metal Alohydrolium, which is the lightest of all metals, eight times lighter than aluminum.

The automatic packing machine would pack anything from a small package a few inches square up to a box two feet high by three f eet long. The clever part, however, was that it made the box to suit the size of the final package, placed the articles together, packed them into the box which was not yet finished, then folded the box after the handle had been stamped out, stenciled the firm's name on two sides and delivered the box completely packed, all within ten to fifteen seconds.

The box could either be taken along or else the clerk would stencil the customer's name and address right into the handle, place a triangular packet-post stamp on the box and drop it into a chute beside the counter. The box would then chute down into the Packet-Post Conveyor, located from seventy-five to one hundred feet below the level of the street, where it would land on a belt-like arrangement moving at the rate of five miles an hour. The action was entirely automatic and the chute was arranged with an automatic shutter which would only open when there was no package immediately below on the moving belt. This preclud'ed the possibility of packages tumbling on top of each other and thus blocking the conveyor-tube.

When the package had landed on the conveyor-belt it traveled to the nearest distributor office, where the post office clerk would take it from the belt and see if it was franked correctly. The stamp would then be cancelled automatically and af ter the clerk had noted the address he would route it to the sub-station nearest to the addressee's home. He then clamped onto the package an automatic metal "rider" which was of a certain height, irrespective of the size of the package.

The package with its rider was then placed on the express conveyor belt traveling at the rate of 25 miles an hour. This express belt, bearing our package, moved at a steady speed and never stopping, passed numerous sub-stations on the way. At the correct sub-station the rider of our package would come against a contact arrangement _stretching across the belt at right angles, at a certain height. This contact arrangement would close the circuit of a powerf ul electromagnet placed in the same line with the contact arrangement, a few feet away from the express belt. The electromagnet would act immediately on the metal package, (Alohydrolium being a magnetic metal) drawing it in a flash into the sub-station from the belt. If there was another package right behind the one just delivered, it would be handled in the same manner. This system worked with absolute perf ection and never failed.

After the package had arrived at the sub-station it would be despatched to its final destination. Another rider would be attached to it and the package would be placed on a local conveyor belt passing by the house of its destination. After arriving at the correct address its rider would strike the contact arrangement overhead, which operated the electro- magnet, pulling the package into the basement of the house, where it would fall on the platform of an electric dumb-waiter. The dumb-waiter would start upward automatically and the package would be delivered at once to the butler or other servant.

Thus a package would be delivered in the average space of forty minutes from the time of purchase. Some packages of course could be delivered in a much shorter time and others which had to travel to the city limits took of course much longer.

"How really wonderful !" Miss 212B 423 exclaimed af ter 124C 41 had explained the system, "it must have taken decades to build such a stupendous system."

"No, not quite," was the reply, "it was built gradually with an enormous number of workers building it. The tubes are even now extended almost daily to keep pace with the growth of the city."

124C 41 then took his guests up to the roof of an aerocab stand and they boarded a fast flyer.

"Take us about 10,000 feet up," 124C 41 said to the driver.

"You have not much time," was the driver's reply, "at 12 o'clock we have to be down again."

"How so?"

"Don't you know today is the 15th of September, the night of the aerial carnival ? And you know it's against the law to go up over New York until it's all over. We have twenty-five minutes left, however, if you wish to go up."

"I clear forgot about this aerial carnival," 124C 41 replied, "but twenty-five minutes is time enough if you speed up your 'machine."
The aerial flyer rose quickly, almost silently. The objects below began to shrink and within three minutes the lights became slightly fainter.

In about ten minutes an altitude of about twelve thousand feet was reached, and as it became too cold, 124C 41 motioned to the driver not to rise further. 

The spectacle which unfolded itself below his guests was indescribable. As far as the eye could see a broad expanse studded with lights, like a carpet embroidered with diamonds, was laid out. Thousands of aerial craft with their powerful search lights moved silently about and once in a while an immense transatlantic aerial liner would swish over the horizon with tremendous speed, the flare of its flashlights long in evidence after the disappearance of the liner.

The most beautiful as well as wonderful sight, however, were. the Signalizers. In the first period of aerial navigation large electric lamps forming figures and letters were placed on housetops so that the aerial craft above would better find its destination. While a similar method is of course still in use, it goes without saying that for aerial vessels 5,000 feet or higher up in the air such signals are wholly inadequate, as they cannot be made out correctly at such a distance. Hence the signalizers. These are nothing but tremendously powerful search- lights of the most advanced type, mounted on certain buildings. These searchlights are trained skyward and thus shoot a powerf ul shaf t of light directly upward. No aerial craft is allowed to cross such light shaf ts under penalty. Each light shaf t gives a different signal ; thus the signalizer in Herald Square is first white ; in ten seconds it changes to red and in a further ten seconds it becomes yellow. Thus even an aerial liner out at sea can see the signal and steer right to the Herald Square pier, without being obliged to hover over the city in search of its pier. Some signalizers have only one color, flashing from time to time. Other more important ones use two searchlights at one time, like the one at Sandy Hook. This signalizer has two light shafts, one green and one red ; these do not change colors, nor do they light periodically.

From high above our friends marvelled at these signalize.rs, ·which pierced the darkness all around them. It was an inspiring sight to watch the hundreds of light shaf ts, especially the ones changing colors, the weird beauty of it all thrilling sensitive Miss 212B 423 into ecstasy :

"Oh, if I could only watch this beautiful spectacle forever," she exclain;ed, "it is so amazing, so superb ! A fairyland could not demand more to satisfy its tenants." She stopped short as she noticed that the aerocab was descending rapidly and in a f ew minutes the strong light from below had obliterated the light shafts. As the craf t drew closer the streets could be seen extending for miles like white ribbons and the bril liantly lighted squares stood out prominentlv. In a short while they landed, at the stroke of twelve. 124C 41 bade his guests sit down on the few unoccupied chairs and only then did they notice that hundreds of people were seated watching the sky expectantly.

At the last stroke of twelve, all the lights below went out and simultaneously with them the light shaf ts of all the searchlights. Everything was plunged in an utter darkness, an unusual experience for everyone, especially for a New Yorker.

Suddenly overhead at a great height the flag of the United States in immense proportions was seen. It was composed of about 6,000 aerial flyers all flying together in the same plane, with the same speed. Each one of course had very powerful lights on the bottom ; some had white lights, other red ones, other blue ones. Thus an immense flag in its correct colors was formed and so exactly did the flyers work that, although they all were at least 50 feet apart from each other, the effect below was that of a real cloth flag, illuminated by a searchlight. Suddenly fhe immense flag began to move ; it passed slowly overhead, describing a large circle, turning at the same time in its plane, so that the entire population below obtained a perfect view.

Everyone applauded and thousands shouted themselves hoarse at the inspiring sight. Then suddenly the flag disappeared as if destroyed and nothing could be seen in the darkness. 124C 41 explained to his guests that the lights of each one of the aerial flyers had been turned off in preparation of the next spectacle, and that there was no cause for apprehension.

Suddenly there was seen an enormous colored' circle, composed of course of all the flyers. The circle revolved with great rapidity, becoming smaller and smaller, as though it were shrinkino. Finally it became a colored disc revoling rapidly around its axis. After a few s_econds, the edge opned and a straight line shot out---the disc unrolled like a tape measure. After a few minutes there remained nothing of the disc, it had resolved itself into a perf ectlv straight colored line, miles long. The all the lights went out again. The next spectacle was a demonstration of the solar system. In the center a large sun was seen standing still. Next to the "sun" a red small round globe revolved quickly around it ; this globe represented the planet Mercury. Around both the sun and "planet" Mercury revolved another globe, blue in color ; this represented Venus. Then followed another globe, a white one, the "Earth." Close to the "Earth" another small globe revolving around the large globe was perceived. This represented the Earth's moon. Next came the red planet Mars with its two small moons, then green Jupiter and its moons, Saturn in yellow. Uranus in orange and lastly Neptune in pink, all globes and their moons traveling commonly in their orbits around the "sun." While the spectacle was in progress a white "comet" with a long tail traveled across the paths of the planets, turned a sharp corner around the "sun," its tail always pointing away from that body, recrossed the orbits of the "planets" again on the other side and lost itself soon in the darkness. Several more spectacles were then shown, one more superb than the one preceding it. The carnival closed with an excellent reproduction in colod of the portrait of the Planet Governor. This was greeted with unanimous applause and was exhibited for fully five minutes.

For a long time af ter the aerial carnival, 124C 41's guests exhausted themselves in various adjectives trying to express their undisguised admiration with wonderf ul, grandiose, incomparable, astounding, and so on.

"We have never witnessed such marvellous spectacles," Mr. 212B 423 remarked. "It takes you Americans to produce original ideas ; upon my word, the old saying 'Nothing is impossible in America,' still holds good."

124C 41 and his guests then rolled home as it had become somewhat late. They went upstairs then and 124C 41 ordered his butler to serve a few refreshments in the Bacillatorium.

The Bacillatorium, invented in 25,09 by the Swede lA 299, is a small room, the walls and bottom of which are composed of lead. On the four sides of the room large vacuum bulbs are stationed on pedestals. These peculiar tubes a foot in height and about six 'inches thick and two feet in diameter are fitted out with a large concave Radio-arcturium cathode ; the glass of the tube in front of the cathode has a double wall, the space of which is filled with helium gas.

The rays emanating from the cathode, when the tube is energised with high oscillatory currents, are called Arcturium Rays and have the great property to kill in a few seconds any bacteria and bacilli, no matter what kind. Arcturium Rays like X-Rays pass through solid objects, such as the human body, but when u'sed alone produce bad burns on the human body. It was found, however, that by filtering arcturium rays through helium no burns on the human body would result, hence all arcturium-ray tubes have a helium filter in front of the cathode.

Now when the entire human body is exposed to such filtered arcturium rays, any germ or bacillus in or on the body will positively be killed off in a very few seconds.

The bacillatorium has been prescribed by law and each citizen is under obligation to use it at least every other day, and better ach day. Thus it is impossible for the human body to develop contagious diseases, if it has been subjected regularly to arcturium rays. It has been estimated that even as late as in the twentieth century over 50 per cent. of all deaths were directly attributable to contagious and other diseases occasioned by germs or bacilli.

Thus since the introduction of the bacillatorium such diseases are unheard of and people now die only of old age, accidents or mind troubles. Infection is impossible. The arcturium-rays besides seem to have a highly beneficial effect on animal tissue and people subjected to the bacilfatorium treatment now live from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and forty years, where in former centuries seventy years was the high average.
